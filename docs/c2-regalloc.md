# MSVC 5 register allocation, read from C2.EXE

This is the register allocator of the back end we build with
(`toolchain/msvc5-sp3/BIN/C2.EXE`, VC++ 5.0 SP3), read with Ghidra and checked
against small test programs. It follows the frame-layout work in #5113 (see
"Get the frame layout from the reference counts" in `docs/agent-guide.md`). All
addresses are C2.EXE's own.

C2.EXE was built with basic-block reordering, so most functions are split
into hot and cold pieces far apart. Ghidra's function boundaries are therefore
rough, and assertion sites tell you which source file a piece came from: the
allocator is `color.c` (assertions at 0x4676b7, 0x46915e, 0x4692bb, 0x469309)
plus code generation's temporary assignment in `regasg.c`.

## Where it runs

`FUN_00453305` is the per-function pipeline. With global optimisation on
(`/Og`, flag `DAT_0048fb4c`), the order is: global optimiser, then
`FUN_00414a64` (builds the register candidates: one per web of a local,
parameter, compiler temporary or constant), then `FUN_00416e6a` (the global
allocator, color.c), then `FUN_0042a8aa` (assigns registers to expression
temporaries during code generation and cleans up afterwards).

Several decisions below depend on `DAT_0048fb60`, bit 23 of the per-function
optimisation flags. Every decision we could test behaves as if it is set under
`/O2`, so the rules below assume it (it is most likely `/Ot`).

## Register numbers and the order table

C2 numbers registers eax 1, ecx 2, edx 3, ebx 4, esp 5, ebp 6, esi 7, edi 8
(name table at 0x49d698). Both allocators walk the same order, stored twice:

    0x49b4a8 (global allocator) and 0x491100 (temporaries):
    eax, ecx, edx, esi, edi, ebx, ebp

ebp is in the table only when the function has no frame pointer
(`FUN_0041be92`: 7 integer registers with frame-pointer omission, 6 without).

## Global allocator (color.c): which local gets which register

Functions: `FUN_00416e6a` (driver), `FUN_0040ebb6` (creates a candidate),
`FUN_0040ee1d` (priorities), `FUN_0041bdd7` and `FUN_0041b6fa` (priority list),
`FUN_0041a6f8` (drops candidates not worth a register), `FUN_0041b785` (picks
the register), `FUN_0041ba2b` (updates the neighbours), `FUN_00439385`
(live-range splitting).

It is a priority-based colouring (Chow and Hennessy style), not Chaitin's
simplify-and-select:

1. **Candidates.** Every web of a local, parameter, compiler temporary
   (induction variables, loop counters) and constant gets a 0x44-byte candidate
   with a sequential id. Its "allowed" set starts as all registers of its class
   (integer or x87), minus ebp when there is a frame pointer. A web that is live
   across a call loses eax, ecx and edx. A web that interferes with a
   hard-register use (a `rep movs`, a shift count, a division) loses that register.

2. **Dropped candidates.** A candidate with fewer than 2 references and a
   weighted reference total below 1 stays in memory (`FUN_0041a6f8`). A
   candidate whose only two references are a copy is forwarded into its use.

3. **Priority.** `FUN_0040ee1d` walks the basic blocks. For each block `b`:

   - `w(b) = 1 << (loop depth + 1)`, so 2 outside loops, 4 in a loop, 8 in a
     nested loop (block field +0x86 holds the depth);
   - each reference to a variable costs 2, a constant reference 1 or 0
     (`FUN_0040ed6c`, `FUN_0040fada`);
   - `K(b)` is the number of candidates referenced in the block, so references
     in a crowded block weigh more;
   - a candidate referenced in `b` gains `w(b) * K(b) * (its cost in b)`; a
     candidate live through `b` without a reference loses `w(b) * K(b)`.

   The sum is the priority (candidate +0xc). A second total, `w(b) * cost`
   without the `K(b)` factor, is the spill cost (+0x3c) used in step 2.

4. **Order.** Candidates are inserted into a list in id order (from a hash on
   `id & 0x3ff`), sorted by priority, largest first, then by a second key at
   +0x40 that we did not identify. A new candidate goes **before** equal ones.
   In every test this works out as: **on a tie, the variable that appears
   first in the code goes first**, whatever the declaration order.

5. **Choice** (`FUN_0041b785`). For the candidate at the head of the list, each
   allowed register gets a cost, starting at 0. A neighbour that wants a
   specific register (a copy to or from it, such as the return value into eax,
   or a value fed to a fixed-register instruction) adds its preference to
   that register's cost; a neighbour with only one register left adds
   `100 * weight`. The candidate's own preferences subtract. The cheapest
   allowed register wins, and **ties go to the earlier register in the table**
   (strict `<` while walking eax, ecx, edx, esi, edi, ebx, ebp).

6. **Neighbours** (`FUN_0041ba2b`). The chosen register is removed from every
   interfering candidate's allowed set. A neighbour left with nothing is split
   (`FUN_00439385`): it keeps a register where it can and is stored and
   reloaded around the blocks where it cannot. This is the "`this` spilled at
   entry and reloaded after the loop" pattern; it is a split, not a whole spill.

Consequences that agents can use directly:

- A local live across a call can only get esi, edi, ebx, ebp, in that order of
  priority. The highest-priority one gets esi.
- A local not live across a call gets eax, ecx, edx first (unless a neighbour's
  preference makes another register cheaper), then esi, edi, ebx, ebp.
- ebp is used only when esi, edi and ebx are all taken (also enforced after the
  fact by `FUN_0042bf00`, which moves a value in ebp to ebx, esi or edi,
  in that order, if one of them ends up unused).
- To move a variable to an earlier register, give it more weighted references
  than its rival, or, on a tie, make it appear first in the code.

## Temporaries (regasg.c): the scratch rotation

`FUN_00435c37` gives each expression temporary a register during code
generation, after the global allocator has placed the variables:

1. If the temporary has a hint (it is copied to or from a register variable,
   or it holds a value going to a fixed register) and that register is free,
   it takes the hint.
2. Otherwise (with `DAT_0048fb60` set) it takes the first free register among
   eax, ecx, edx **starting from a rotating pointer** (`DAT_00491120`), and the
   pointer moves to the register after the one chosen. The pointer is reset to
   eax once per function (`FUN_0042a8aa`), not per statement or per block. So
   consecutive temporaries rotate eax, ecx, edx, eax, ..., skipping registers
   that hold variables or live temporaries.
3. Otherwise the first free register in table order (eax, ecx, edx, esi, edi,
   ebx, ebp).
4. Otherwise a register is freed by spilling (`FUN_0045a827`, `FUN_0045d93e`,
   `FUN_0045d33f`).

`FUN_0042b2c4` is a second round-robin over the whole table (with a per-block
reset) used by `FUN_0042b3e2`, a pass that renames registers for Pentium
pairing.

## Constants in registers

Constants are candidates too (kind 0xd). A constant reference costs 1, and
references that could just as well be immediates cost 0, so a constant needs
several uses to win a register. After code generation, `FUN_0042bf00` checks
each callee-saved register that holds only constants and gives it back
(re-materialising the immediates) if its weighted benefit is below 3.
Measured with `p->f[i] = 0` stores:

| stores of 0 | no call in between | a call after each store |
|---|---|---|
| 1 to 2 | immediates | immediates |
| 3 to 4 | `xor ecx, ecx` | immediates |
| 5 or more | `xor ecx, ecx` | `xor edi, edi` (callee-saved) |

## Validation

All tests compile with the project flags (`/O2 /Ob2 /MT /Gz`) and read the
`/Fa` listing. The scripts generate random C functions, predict each local's
register from the rules above and compare.

| test | what it checks | result |
|---|---|---|
| straight-line, calls between uses (2 to 5 locals, 0 to 5 extra uses each, random definition order) | priority = reference count in one block; ties by first appearance; esi, edi, ebx, ebp; fifth local in memory | 820 of 820 |
| straight-line leaf code (2 to 6 locals loaded from globals, 1 to 5 uses each) | same ranking onto eax, ecx, edx, esi, edi, ebx | 460 of 460 |
| ties with declaration order reversed, definition order reversed, and use order reversed | first appearance in code wins, declaration order does not matter | 5 of 5 |
| the same tie after 0 to 69 unused `extern` declarations | ties do not depend on earlier symbols | 70 of 70 stable |
| scratch rotation (four `G[i] = G[j] + k` statements; the same through a pointer held in eax) | eax, ecx, edx, eax; and ecx, edx, ecx, edx when eax is taken | as predicted |
| loop weighting (one local used k times in a loop, its rival N times before it) | a loop reference is worth several straight-line ones | see below |

Loop weighting, measured. Local `a` is used `k` times inside a loop and once
in the peeled first iteration; `b` is used `N` times before the loop. `b`
first takes esi at:

| loop | k = 1 | k = 2 | k = 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `for (;;) { g(a); if (g(9)) break; }` (depth 1) | N = 6 | N = 9 | N = 13 |
| the same loop nested in another (depth 2) | N = 19 or 20 | N = 31 or 32 | |
| `while (n--) g(a);` (depth 1, with a counter) | N = 5 | N = 7 | |

Both depth-1 shapes fit the priority sum above with one ratio,
`w1 * K1 / (w0 * K0) = 8/3`, ties going to `a`: for the `for (;;)` shape `b`
wins when `w0 * K0 * (N - k) > w1 * K1 * (1 + 2k) / 2`, for the counter loop
when `w0 * K0 * N > w1 * K1 * (1 + 2k) / 2`. The weight ratio `w1 / w0` in the
code is 2, which needs `K1 / K0 = 4/3`; a plain count of the values touched in
each block gives 2/3 at most. So the `K(b)` term
counts more than the source-level locals (compiler temporaries such as call
results and loop counters are candidates too), and we could not reproduce it
exactly from source. In practice: **one reference inside a loop is worth
about 3 to 4 references outside it, and one inside a nested loop about 12**.

## The coordinator's observations, checked

1. *A constant 0 is held in a register depending on how many uses are
   counted.* Confirmed: constants are candidates, need several weighted uses
   (3 stores for a scratch register, 5 for a callee-saved one, table above),
   and `FUN_0042bf00` gives a callee-saved register back when a constant's
   benefit is below 3. A shared tail written as an inline helper called from two
   arms is counted twice before the arms merge, so it can push the zero over
   the threshold (0x4a4170).
2. *Per-statement scratch rotation ecx, edx, eax.* Confirmed and explained:
   a round-robin pointer over eax, ecx, edx that is reset once per function
   and advances past each register handed to a temporary. So any change in
   the number or order of temporaries earlier in the function shifts every
   later one: reordering statements (0x4876c0) and adding a temporary
   (0x4b5980) both work through this pointer. Our guess for the latter is that
   the temporary was given a register and then folded away, advancing the
   pointer without emitting code.
3. *A local split between a register and a stack home counts one extra
   reference.* Consistent: the split (`FUN_00439385`) adds a store or reload
   tuple that the frame-layout count sees. Not separately tested here.
4. *Inline helper boundaries change allocation without adding code.*
   Consistent: an inlined helper's parameters and locals are separate
   candidates (later coalesced with the copies), so they change the per-block
   counts `K(b)`, the candidate ids that break ties, and the copy preferences in
   step 5.
5. *A field's declared width changed register choice elsewhere.* Plausible
   through `K(b)`: a different width changes the temporaries in that block
   (a `movzx` load and so on), which changes the weight of every reference
   in the block. Not tested.

## Stuck functions

No stuck function moved in this session; the time went into reading C2 and the
validation suite. What the model says about them:

- **0x4cf570** (`this` spilled at entry and reloaded): that is a split
  (step 6). `this` must lose the loop region to the loop's own locals on
  priority while keeping esi outside it. The extra do-while level that
  reaches 90.2% works by raising the loop's weight (`w(b)` doubles per loop
  level and `K(b)` is large there). A version with the same weights and no
  extra test would need another way to add loop-weighted references to bestidx
  and best, or to remove references to `this` inside the loop.
- **0x487080** (one step of the bit-copy chain on edx instead of ecx): this is
  the temporary rotation, not the global allocator. Each step's temporary takes
  the next free scratch register after the previous one, so the original has
  one extra or one fewer temporary (or a hinted copy) earlier in the
  function than ours. Count the temporaries the original creates before the
  chain, including ones that emit no code. (A hypothesis from the rule, not
  tested on the file.)
- **0x4a3780** (`flags` in a register against in memory): `flags` wins a
  register because `flag8`'s loop uses share it at the in-place shift. In the
  original it stays in memory, so its priority there must be below the
  register's other claimants, or its spill-cost total must fall below 1
  (step 2). The file's probe that makes `flags` live across the 0x10 path's
  calls (removing eax, ecx, edx from its allowed set) reproduces the original
  frame, which fits: with only callee-saved registers left, `flags` loses to
  higher-priority locals.
- **0x453d40** (8944 bytes): too large for hand counting. The rules above say
  which way each change pushes priorities, but a function this size needs a
  tool that reproduces C2's blocks and candidates.

## Not done

- `tools/regalloc.py`: a predictor would need C2's basic blocks, webs and
  compiler temporaries, which are not visible in the source. A predictor for
  straight-line code is in the validation scripts, but it would not help with
  real functions. The useful next step is the exact `K(b)` count, from the
  three sets `FUN_0040ee1d` adds up at 0x40f5c9 to 0x40f704.
- The second sort key at candidate +0x40.
- `FUN_0041a985` (532 lines), which builds the conflict and preference
  information before each choice, was skimmed, not read.
