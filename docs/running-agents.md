# Running agents on the project

This describes the decompile round, which ended when every function matched.
Agents now work on `cleanup` issues as `AGENTS.md` describes.

Work is handed out as GitHub issues labelled `decomp`, each listing a few
functions. Any coding agent can take part: it reads `AGENTS.md` (OpenCode and
Codex both load it automatically), claims an unassigned issue, works in its own
copy of the repository and opens a pull request. The orchestrator re-checks the
pull request, merges it, records which model did what, and opens new issues.

## One-time setup

Everything runs from the main checkout, `~/repos/personal/byte-tactics`, which
must already have the toolchain (`tools/setup_toolchain.sh`), the original exe
in `orig/` and the Ghidra export in `build/ghidra/`. The agent also needs the
GitHub CLI logged in (`gh auth status`), because it claims issues, pushes
branches and opens pull requests with it.

Agents create their working copies in `.worktrees/issue-<N>` (ignored by git),
linked to the main checkout's toolchain, so several can run at once from one
machine.

## OpenCode

```sh
cd ~/repos/personal/byte-tactics
opencode
```

OpenCode runs as a lead plus cheap workers:

- **The lead** is the model you pick with `/models`, ideally GLM-5.3 or
  Grok 4.7. It claims the issue, sets up the worktree, reviews the results,
  retries what the workers left and opens the pull request.
- **The workers** are the `decomp-worker` subagent defined in
  `.opencode/agents/decomp-worker.md`. The file sets no model, so they run on
  whatever model the session was started with (OpenCode gives a subagent
  without a `model:` line its caller's model). They do the first attempt at
  each function, one worker per function, all at once.
- **When workers stop:** a worker keeps going while its best score improves
  and stops when it has not improved in 30 check runs or 60 minutes (the rule
  in `AGENTS.md`). The file's `steps` (400) is only a safety net: a worker
  that runs out of steps while still improving says so, and the session
  starts a fresh one from its file.
- **Free sessions:** start a session on a free model such as Space Bunny Free
  (`opencode/space-bunny-free`, see `opencode models | grep free`) and its
  workers run on it too, so it costs nothing and you can run as many as you
  like. Record its results under its own name (`record.py <issue>
  space-bunny-free ...`) and send its leftovers back to the ordinary queue with
  `--escalate retry`, for DeepSeek to try next.

To run the workers on a different model from the lead, add a `model:` line to
that file. Your OpenCode Go plan limits spending per model: DeepSeek V4.1 Flash and Kimi K3
have lower caps than GLM-5.3 and Grok 4.7, and each cap applies per 5 hours,
per week and per month.

Give the lead this prompt:

> Follow AGENTS.md: pick up the lowest-numbered unassigned `decomp` issue,
> hand its functions to decomp-worker subagents, retry what they leave, and
> open a pull request. Then pick up the next one, until none are left.

Every model may take any issue, including those labelled `hard` (functions
over 1000 bytes). To steer a model, add a size label to the prompt, for
example "only take `size:medium` issues".

For an unattended run, `opencode run` takes the same prompt on the command
line, with `-m opencode-go/glm-5.3` to choose the lead (check
`opencode run --help`). Run several in separate terminals; each claims a
different issue.

OpenCode asks before running shell commands unless you allow them. The agent
needs to run `uv`, `gh`, `git` and the compiler (Wine) freely, so allow those
for this project.

## Codex

```sh
cd ~/repos/personal/byte-tactics
codex
```

Choose a model with `/model` and give it this prompt:

> Follow AGENTS.md: pick up the lowest-numbered unassigned `decomp` issue,
> decompile it and open a pull request. Then pick up the next one, until none
> are left.

To point it at the biggest functions, add "labelled `hard`" to the prompt.

Codex usage goes quickly on long decompilation sessions. To make it last:

- **One Codex session at a time.**
- **Lower reasoning effort.** Set `model_reasoning_effort = "medium"` in
  `~/.codex/config.toml`, or pass `-c model_reasoning_effort="medium"`.
  Raise it again only for a stubborn near-miss.

For an unattended run, `codex exec "<prompt>"`.

Codex runs commands in a sandbox. The agent needs network access (for `gh`
and `git push`) and needs to run Wine. If either is blocked, start Codex with
`--sandbox danger-full-access` (check `codex --help` for the current flag
names). This is your own repository and machine, and the agent only needs the
repository folder.

## Which model

Last night's calibration (`docs/agents.md`) covered Claude models only. Opus
matched 99-100% of functions up to 160 bytes and about 80% at 161-260 bytes.
What's left is mostly the harder, larger functions.

- **Codex, GPT-6 Astra.** OpenAI reports it solves 88% of a
  binary reverse-engineering benchmark first time. That is not the same task
  as matching decompilation, but it makes Astra a strong candidate for the
  `hard` issues (functions over 1000 bytes).
- **OpenCode.** There is no track record here for any of these models. The
  likeliest candidates are the larger, non-Flash ones (GPT-6 Luna, Kimi K3,
  GLM-5.3, Qwen3.8 Max, MiMo-V2.6-Pro, Grok 4.7). Give two or three of them a
  `size:medium` issue each and compare.
- **Measuring.** Every pull request names its model, and `tools/record.py`
  logs the orchestrator's re-check under that name. `docs/agents.md` then
  shows each model's match rate by function size. Use those numbers, not
  reputation, to decide who gets which issues. If a plan is flat-rate rather
  than per token, match rate is the number that matters.

## The orchestrator's loop

Run from the main checkout, on `main`:

1. **Keep issues open.** Open a handful per size:
   - `uv run tools/issues.py --band medium --count 6`
   - `uv run tools/issues.py --band large --count 6`

   Near-misses to retry:
   - `uv run tools/issues.py --addresses ... --title "Near-misses" --label near-miss --escalation`
2. **Review each pull request.**
   - `tools/review.sh <PR>` checks the pull request out in `.worktrees/pr-<PR>`
     and merges `origin/main` into it. It lists the changed files, rebuilds
     `data/symbols.csv` as the real merge will, re-checks every function in
     the pull request, lists any function that matches on `main` but would
     stop matching (usually two files disagreeing on a callee's name), and
     flags forbidden constructs.
   - Read the files for made-up names, and fix bad matches before merging.
   - Squash-merge with a commit message in the project's format:
     `gh pr merge <PR> --squash --delete-branch --subject "Add: ..." --body "..."`.
   - `tools/review.sh <PR> --clean` removes the worktree.
3. **Merge and record.** Squash-merge, then on `main`:
   - `uv run tools/progress.py` first, so the names record.py checks against
     include the ones this merge added.
   - `uv run tools/record.py <issue> <model> --escalate retry`. Add
     `--model-for <addr>=<model>` for each function another model (such as a
     worker) wrote. `--escalate retry` opens an ordinary `near-miss` issue any
     model can take for everything left unmatched, including what a retry
     missed again. Since 2026-09-29 every model may take any issue, `hard`
     included, so every model's leftovers are escalated this way.
   - `uv run tools/progress.py`
   - `uv run tools/calibration.py`

   Add any suspected original bugs to `docs/bugs.md` and new techniques to
   `docs/agent-guide.md`, commit and push.
4. **Clean up what was left.** Everything left unmatched goes back out as a
   retry that any model may take; since 2026-10-01 no issue is reserved for
   one model (the old `claude` label is gone).
5. **Fix bad matches too.** A cheap model's file can match and still be wrong
   in other ways: `__fastcall` free functions, hand-stored vtables, invented
   names. The orchestrator fixes those during review, or with a subagent,
   before merging.
6. **Release stale claims.** For a claim with no pull request and no recent
   work (no pushed branch, and nothing changed anywhere in its
   `.worktrees/issue-<N>`, including `build/`, for a couple of hours), ask the
   human whether that session is still running: Codex and OpenCode sessions
   pause on usage limits and resume later. If it has stopped, check whether
   the uncommitted work beats `main`
   (`tools/checkall.py` in both), then unassign the issue and comment
   "Released by the orchestrator: <why>". Agents treat an issue as free when
   its most recent "Claimed by"/"Released" comment is a release, so the
   comment must start with "Released".
