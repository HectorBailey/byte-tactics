# Decompiling a function: guide for agents

You are turning functions from Total Annihilation's `TotalA.exe` (1998, compiled
with Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 SP3) back into C++ that compiles to **exactly the
same machine code**. A result only counts when `tools/check.py` prints `MATCH`;
every claimed match is re-verified independently.

Work from the repository root: `~/repos/personal/byte-tactics`.

## The loop, per function

1. `uv run tools/ctx.py 0x<addr>`: disassembly annotated with names, strings and
   float constants, facts about arguments and calling convention, what each
   callee expects, and Ghidra's pseudo-C (a rough starting point; its types and
   control flow are often wrong).
2. Write `src/unsorted/0x<addr>.cpp` (lower-case hex, e.g. `0x4010b0.cpp`).
3. `uv run tools/check.py 0x<addr>`: compiles your file and prints `MATCH`, or a
   similarity % with a diff (`-` lines are the original, `+` lines are yours).
   Addresses the linker fills in show as `<addr>` in the diff; in your own
   `/Fa` listings or object file they appear as 0 or as a symbol name. That is
   normal and not a bug in your declarations.
4. Adjust and repeat. Stop at `MATCH`, or when you run out of attempts for that
   function; leave your best (highest %) version in the file either way.

## Finding a class from an address

When `ctx.py` shows your function using `this` or a class pointer and you need
the layout, matched code has probably already declared that class:

    uv run tools/unitmap.py --at 0x<addr>

It prints the matched functions nearest the address, the class (unit) they
belong to, the class's fields with their offsets and the file each came from,
any offset whose views disagree, and its matched members, which are near copies
of the function you are writing. `uv run tools/unitgen.py <unit>` writes that
whole class under `build/units/` (never committed); copy the declaration you need
into your own file. The map only holds matched members, and it only flags a
dispute where a file carries a `// +0xN` comment, so an empty dispute list means
"nothing was flagged", not "the views agree". More in `docs/consolidation.md`.

## Rules

- Only create or edit `src/unsorted/0x<addr>.cpp` for the addresses you were
  given. Do not touch anything else (tools, data, include, other files), do not
  run `tools/progress.py`, and do not commit.
- No inline assembly or byte emission (`__asm`, `_emit`) and no
  `#pragma optimize`/`code_seg`; the checker rejects them. Compiler flags are
  fixed (`/O2 /Ob2 /MT /Gz`: `/Ob2` means the compiler inlines small
  functions on its own); do not try to change them. The one exception is a
  `// FLAGS: /Gi` line, for the ties described under "When the registers or
  the order won't budge".
- Each file must compile on its own: define the structs/classes you need in the
  file, and declare (don't define) the functions and globals you call or use. Under /Gi a function that still has an unresolved tie can score differently depending on the length of the source file's path (0x408100 gave 98.5% in one directory and 99.0% in another), so check a /Gi partial from a second directory before trusting a gain. Matched /Gi files are stable: all 17 on 2026-10-03 match from four different path lengths.

## File template

```cpp
// Decompiled by <model>. Names are provisional.
#include <string.h>   // only what you need

struct Unit;                         // opaque when only passed around

class Weapon {                       // fields at the offsets the code uses
public:
    char unknown_0[0x10];
    int damage;                      // +0x10
    int FUN_004b4ba0(char* name);    // callee declared, not defined
    void FUN_00401234(Unit* target);
};

extern int DAT_00511de8;             // global, declared extern

// FUNCTION: 0x401234
void Weapon::FUN_00401234(Unit* target)
{
    ...
}
```

The `// FUNCTION: 0x<addr>` line must sit directly above the definition.

## Names

- If `ctx.py` shows a name for a callee or global (anything other than
  `FUN_...`/`DAT_...`), use exactly that name, including the class
  (`PlayerRef::Reset`); the checker fails references that disagree with names
  already established.
- Otherwise use `FUN_<8 hex digits>` for functions and `DAT_<8 hex digits>` for
  globals, e.g. `FUN_004b4ba0`, `DAT_00511de8`. Name your own function
  `FUN_<addr>` too unless its purpose is obvious.
- If your function is a method and its class has no known name yet, call the
  class `Class_<8 hex digits of your function's address>`, e.g.
  `Class_00401234::FUN_00401234`.
- A callee called as a method (ecx set to an object just before the call)
  that `ctx.py` shows without a name is always `Class_<callee address>::FUN_<callee address>`,
  the same name its own author will give it. If your object has a different
  class, cast: `((Class_00437a20*)obj)->FUN_00437a20()`. Once a callee has a
  name in `data/symbols.csv`, `ctx.py` shows it and you must use it.
- A callee that is a **constructor** (called on the result of `operator new`,
  or one that stores a vtable and returns `this`) is named as a constructor,
  `Class_<addr>::Class_<addr>`, because that is what its own author will call it.
- A function that is only `ret` or `ret N` is an empty function: an empty body
  with N/4 dword-sized parameters (as a `__thiscall` method if unsure).
  If every caller sets `lea ecx, [esp+N]` to a local object just before calling
  it, at the end of that object's scope, it is that class's empty out-of-line
  destructor (see 0x4e2cb0.cpp); check with
  `objdump -d -M intel orig/TotalA.exe | grep -B14 "call   0x<addr>"`.
- Library calls (`sprintf`, `memset`, `strcpy`, `malloc`, ...) are the normal C
  runtime; include the header and call them.

## Reading the calling convention

- `ctx.py` says how the function returns. `ret N` means the callee removes N bytes
  of arguments: a `__thiscall` member function (if `ecx` is used as a pointer
  before being written) or a `__stdcall` free function. Plain `ret` means
  `__cdecl`, or a `__thiscall` method with no stack arguments.
- The FPO line gives the number of stack argument dwords.
- `__thiscall` is only available for member functions: make it a method of a
  class/struct. A function that only uses `ecx` (not `edx`) as an input
  is a `__thiscall` method, not `__fastcall`: both compile the same, but
  Cavedog wrote methods, and the name you choose is what callers will use.
- **The original was built with `/Gz`, and so is `check.py`** (#2290): a free
  function with no convention written is `__stdcall`. 2308 of the exe's
  functions with stack arguments clean up their own stack and only 78 leave
  it to the caller, so leave the convention out unless the exe shows caller
  cleanup (a plain `ret` in the callee, `add esp, N` after the call), and
  then write `__cdecl`. The CRT headers already say `__cdecl`; a CRT function
  or `operator new`/`delete` you declare by hand needs it written, and so does
  a function passed to `atexit` and a function pointer whose target is
  `__cdecl`. For a function with no stack arguments the ABI cannot show the
  convention; the emitted-shape rule further down (a load hoisted across a
  `push imm` happens only in `__cdecl`) is the test there.
- Files written before the switch said `__stdcall` everywhere it was needed
  and left `__cdecl` implicit; `tools/fix_conventions.py` wrote the `__cdecl`
  back. A residual that survives every rewrite of a free function is often
  its convention or a callee's: check `ret N` against your declaration first.

## Getting MSVC 5 to produce the same code

- Types matter. `movzx`/`and reg, 0xff` loads mean `unsigned char`/`unsigned
  short`; `movsx` means signed. `shr`/`jb`/`ja` mean unsigned; `sar`/`jl`/`jg`
  mean signed. A `short` or `char` parameter still occupies a dword slot.
- Field offsets come from `[reg + 0x..]`; pad structs with `char unknown_X[N]`
  arrays so each field lands at the right offset.
- Register choice and instruction order follow the order of your statements and
  of declarations. Try: reordering statements, introducing or removing a
  temporary variable, swapping comparison operands (`a < b` vs `b > a`),
  `if/else` vs `?:`, `for` vs `while` vs `do/while`, early `return` vs one exit,
  pre vs post increment, array indexing vs pointer arithmetic.
- `rep stosd`/`rep movsd` sequences are usually `memset`/`memcpy` (inlined at
  `/O2`), or struct assignment.
- A `switch` usually becomes a jump table or a compare chain.
- x87 code (`fld`, `fstp`, `fmul`...) is `float`/`double` arithmetic; `ctx.py`
  shows constant values. `__ftol` calls are float-to-int casts.
- Small callees may have been inlined in the original, so their bodies appear
  in the disassembly without a `call`.

## When you finish

End your reply with one table row per function you were given:

```
| address | result | best % | check.py runs | notes |
| 0x401234 | MATCH | 100 | 3 | needed unsigned char param |
| 0x401260 | partial | 87.5 | 12 | register swap in loop I could not fix |
```

Keep notes short and specific: what made it hard, what fixed it.

If the code you matched looks like a mistake in the original game (a wrong
allocation size, a read through a null pointer, a result that can never be
true, a field written twice), keep it exactly as the original does, explain it
in a comment in your file, and list it under a "Suspected original bugs"
heading after your table, with the address and your evidence. The orchestrator
records these in `docs/bugs.md`.

## Patterns already solved in this game

Check these before fighting the compiler; each one has cost earlier agents
their whole budget.

- **`push ecx` as the first instruction** usually just reserves 4 bytes of
  stack for a local variable. It is not saving an argument, and `ecx` is not
  necessarily a parameter.
- **`mov eax, ecx` near the start, `this` returned in `eax`**: a C++
  constructor (constructors return `this`), or a method that returns `this` /
  `*this`. Write it as a real constructor, `Class::Class(...)`, or as a method
  returning `Class*`/`Class&`. `ctx.py` prints a hint when it sees this.
- **Storing a `.rdata` address into `[this]`**: the vtable pointer. `ctx.py`
  marks such addresses `vtable? [...]`. Declare the class with virtual methods
  (declared, not defined) and write the constructor; the compiler stores the
  vtable itself. Don't assign it by hand. The checker accepts the compiler's
  vtable name (`??_7Class@B@`) even where an earlier file named that address
  `DAT_...`: a `DAT_<address>` placeholder agrees with any real name for the
  same address, and the real name then replaces it.
- **A global `std::vector`**: a function that copies one byte from an
  uninitialised stack slot (`push ecx; mov al, [esp+3]`), zeroes the next three
  dwords of a global, then calls `atexit` is the compiler-generated
  initialiser for `std::vector<T> global;`. See `src/unsorted/0x438450.cpp`.
  Compiler-generated functions have no definition to annotate, so put the
  symbol after the address: `// FUNCTION: 0x438450 _$E5`.
- **Division by a constant** compiles to a multiply by a "magic" number plus
  shifts. Write the plain division (`x / 48`); if registers or the shift
  sequence differ, the signedness of `x` is usually wrong (`int` adds a sign
  fix-up, `unsigned` doesn't). A guarded division such as "return 0 if the count is
  zero, otherwise a difference divided by 48" matched only when written as one
  ternary, `return n == 0 ? 0 : (b - a) / 48;`, not as an early `return 0`.
- **Loop compares**: `jbe`/`jae` in a loop test means the counter is
  `unsigned`; `sete dl; test dl, dl` means the result of a comparison was
  stored in a `bool` local first.

## When the registers or the order won't budge

**Recheck the control flow before chasing registers.** Several functions that
had long notes about a register tie were really one misplaced block: 0x4aefa0
put both bubble passes inside `if (n != -1)` where the original jumps to the
second pass's setup (73.1% to MATCH once moved). Walk the original's jumps
against your branches first.

**Shared tails.** MSVC copies a shared tail into each arm that reaches it, and
the copies are what reload values from their stack slots. So write one shared
call at the end of an `if / else if` chain rather than a call and `return` in
each arm (0x47ae60), and when two arms must leave values in particular
registers, write the tail into both arms and let MSVC merge them (0x448c70).

**Short locals for short fields.** A bounds test that reads `short` fields
wants `short` locals (`short px = obj->pos.x;`); with `int` locals or the
plain field spelling MSVC copied a size into a spare register and shifted every
jump after it (0x47cc30).

**Get the frame layout from the reference counts.** This is MSVC 5's own rule,
read out of C2.EXE with Ghidra (#5113; it predicted 351 of 351 small tests).
Locals are kept in a list sorted by size (smallest first), then by reference
count (highest first). A count goes up by one per memory reference in code
order (an `inc`/`dec` on memory counts as two, read and write; 0x4a5f40), and a local only moves ahead of same-size locals whose count is strictly
smaller, so ties keep the order in which each local reached its count. Slots are
packed in that list order: a local joins the newest earlier slot it does not
interfere with (and that is at least half its size), otherwise it gets a new
one. If the packed locals total more than 0x80 bytes, the slots are re-sorted by
`refs * 1000 / size`, largest first, with an unstable quicksort, which is why
ties look scrambled in functions with a big local array. Slot 0 is nearest esp.
So give every local its real size, and count the original's references to each
`[esp+N]` slot to predict the order. A local MSVC splits between a register and a
stack home counts one reference more than its visible memory accesses: write one
variable and let MSVC split it, not a register copy plus a memory copy
(0x4cac40). Function-scope locals whose address is taken never share a slot;
block-scoped ones share with locals dead in their block (a declaration in the
middle of the body is still function scope). A file that packs its locals into
one struct can never reproduce any of this. `uv run tools/stackcmp.py <addr>`
shows which locals sit in the wrong slots, and `uv run tools/c2prio.py <addr>
--frame` prints C2's own packing (each local's count, the slot it joins, the
slots' order and offsets).

**Get the registers from priority, then the order table.** Also read out of
C2.EXE (`docs/c2-regalloc.md` has the details, the C2 addresses and the
tests). Both allocators walk one order: eax, ecx, edx, esi, edi, ebx, ebp.
Locals, parameters, compiler temporaries (loop counters, strength-reduced
pointers) and constants are register candidates, coloured one at a time in
priority order (`FUN_00416e6a`, `FUN_0041b785`). Each takes the cheapest
register it is allowed, ties going to the earlier register in the order. A
value live across a call is not allowed eax, ecx or edx, so the top-priority
one gets esi, then edi, ebx, ebp; a value not live across a call starts at
eax. Cost only breaks the order when a neighbour wants a register (the return
value wants eax, a copy wants its source's register), and ebp is used only
when esi, edi and ebx are all taken. Priority (`FUN_0040ee1d`) is a weighted
reference count: 2 per reference, times the loop weight (1 outside loops, 4
in a loop, 8 in a nested one), times the
number of candidates touched in that block, minus a little for each block the
value is live through without a reference. In practice one reference inside a
loop beats 3 to 4 outside it, and one in a nested loop about 12. On equal
priority the key at +0x40 decides, larger first: the number of the
candidate's last write, counting the blocks in order but the tuples inside
each block backwards. So a variable last written in a later block wins, and
within one block the one written first wins. So to move a variable to an
earlier register, add weighted references or move its last write. This
predicted 1,280 of 1,280 generated straight-line tests. **Don't estimate
priorities by hand when it matters: `uv run tools/c2prio.py <addr> [file]`
compiles the file with C2 under a debugger and prints every candidate's real
priority, +0x40 key, list position, name, source lines and register (or
split) in a few seconds, and `--trace` shows each colouring step**
(`docs/c2-regalloc.md`, "Reading C2's own numbers"). It needs gdb. A value whose register is taken by higher-priority
neighbours in part of its range is split, not spilled: it is stored before
that region and reloaded after (the "`this` spilled at entry" pattern).
Expression temporaries are placed afterwards (`FUN_00435c37`): a temporary
copied to or from a register variable takes that register if it is free,
otherwise the next free one of eax, ecx, edx after the last temporary's,
from a pointer that is reset only at the start of the function. That is the
statement-to-statement rotation: adding, removing or reordering one temporary
shifts every later one. A constant goes into a register only with enough uses:
`p->f[i] = 0` needs 3 stores for `xor ecx, ecx` and 5, with calls between
them, for a callee-saved register.

**Try `/Gi` on a tie that no spelling moves.** Some of the original's
translation units were built with `/Gi` (#5035). If a function is stuck on a
register or frame-slot tie (or one SIB byte) that no spelling moves, run
`uv run tools/check.py <addr> <scratch copy> --flags "/O2 /Ob2 /MT /Gz /Gi"`.
If that matches, add `// FLAGS: /Gi` as its own line near the top of the file
and check again without `--flags`. Only `/Gi` is allowed, and never add it to a
file that already matches without it. For `std::vector<T>::insert`, the TU's
other uses of that vector also count: try one `operator=`, `resize`, `reserve`
or copy-constructor use (`docs/field-notes.md` Part 7).

**Run the permuter when a function is close and stuck.** At about 90% or
more, `uv run tools/permute.py <addr>` searches meaning-preserving rewrites of
the file (statement and declaration order, temporaries, operand order, loop
forms, inline helpers and more) for 15 minutes, and writes the best version to
`build/permute/<addr>/best.cpp` with `best.diff` beside it. Read and tidy the
diff before you use it: the output can include temporaries (`tmp0`) and
helpers (`inl0`) that need a sensible name, and a hunk that looks dead can
still be needed, so re-check with `check.py` after each edit. Commit it only
once it reads as plausible source: self-assignments (`x = x;`), helpers that
return their argument and do-nothing casts can nudge the compiler, but on a
partial they are not worth a few points, since every later attempt starts from
your file. Keep such a gain out of `src/` and list its useful changes as a
lead instead; on a MATCH, keep only what the bytes need and say so in a
comment. A partial gain of tens of points is the exception: on 0x450530 the
self-assignment `g_game->local_player = g_game->local_player;` emits no code
but moves the whole function's register allocation from 59.8% to 98.0%, so it
stays, with a comment giving both scores. Its first run
matched 0x4ac970, 0x4be400 and 0x4b3770 in under a minute each, after many
attempts by hand. `docs/permuter.md` has the options and how to read the
output. `docs/routing.md` covers triage: which functions the permuter and a
proposal loop can each move, `tools/classify.py` and `tools/jev_route.py`, and
`tools/propose.py` for the batch proposal loop.

**When the diff is stack slots, name them first.** `uv run tools/stackcmp.py
<addr>` compiles the file once more with `/Z7` to read each local's frame offset
from CodeView, lines our instructions up with the original's, and prints where
the original keeps each of our locals (`ok`, `moved`, `unused`, `not paired`).
Arrays and structs count every access inside them. A `moved` local whose target
is a parameter slot (`+0x8`) is one the original stored in a dead parameter's
slot. The last line is a `--stack` list for the permuter, and `uv run
tools/permute.py <addr> --stack <names>` aims its declaration moves at them.
Original frame offsets that no aligned access of ours reaches usually mean a
missing or extra local, not an ordering problem. `/Z7` leaves every matched
function's code alone but can change a near miss's; the tool warns when it
does, and the table then describes the `/Z7` build.

Cavedog wrote many small helper functions and methods, and `/Ob2` inlined
them. An inlined function boundary changes the order MSVC evaluates things in
and which registers it keeps values in, so when source-level shuffling has no
effect, the missing piece is usually a helper that was inlined:

- If swapping the operands of `this->a + this->b` changes nothing, move the
  expression into a small `static inline` helper that takes the object
  pointer (`MidX(this)` doing `w->x1 + w->x2`); MSVC then keeps the source
  order. See `src/unsorted/0x44dc60.cpp`.
- A value that sits in a scratch register on one path, and is copied into
  place (`mov edx, ebp`) just before the paths merge on the other, is the
  return value of an inlined function with one `return` per path. A local
  assigned on both paths gets a callee-saved register for the whole function
  instead. See `src/unsorted/0x4c9290.cpp`.
- A loop that walks a pointer, where the offset is added after the loop
  guard (`add eax, K` after `test/jle`), is plain array indexing
  (`arr[i].field`) in the source; adding the offset yourself moves the `add`
  before the guard. A `cmp ptr, end; jl` loop over a global array is a signed
  `int i` for-loop that MSVC turned into a pointer loop.
- For `imul reg, [mem]`, the register operand is usually the left side of `*`
  in the source, but not always. The fold itself depends on the operand: a
  zero-extended byte folds into `imul reg, [mem]`, while a sign-extended
  short was always loaded into a register first (0x47d0e0, #1861). And at
  0x47de60 both operand orders compiled to the same bytes (#2123). If swapping
  the operands changes nothing, operand order is not the lever.
- **`ret N` with no matching stack reads**: the function has unused trailing
  parameters. Declare them (`int unused`) instead of fighting the cleanup.
- **Return types**: `mov al, cl` at the end means a `bool`/`char` return;
  `mov eax, ecx` means `int`.
- **Bit toggles**: a `not`/`xor`/`and`/`xor` sequence on one bit is
  `f->flag = !f->flag;` on a 1-bit bitfield. Place the bitfield so the bit
  lands where the mask says (mask 0x8 is bit 3).
- **x87 sums in the wrong order**: write the sum as sequential accumulation
  (`r = a*d; r = r + b*e; r = r + c*f;`) so the compiler cannot reassociate it.
- **MSVC STL templates**: a `__thiscall` that loops from a pointer argument to
  `[ecx+8]` and then stores into `[ecx+8]` is probably `std::vector<T>::erase`
  (members `_First` +4, `_Last` +8, `_End` +0xc). To make the compiler emit the
  template out of line, take its address in a global
  (`EraseFn g = &std::vector<T>::erase;`) and put the mangled symbol after the
  address in the `// FUNCTION:` line. See `src/unsorted/0x40cfb0.cpp`.
- **A `std::vector` member starts 4 bytes before its `_First`**: the empty
  allocator byte sits at +0, padded to 4, even inside a `pack(1)` class (the
  header's own packing applies). When the original re-reads `_First` after an
  inlined `size()`, use a real `std::vector` member rather than raw pointer
  fields, which let the compiler reuse the loaded value (see 0x4c45e0.cpp).
- **A matched sibling's wording can fail once inlined**: a helper phrasing that
  matches out of line may allocate registers differently when inlined into a
  bigger function; try the plainest form (`if (i >= N) i = 0; return v;`).
- **Addresses are always symbols**: never write an address as a number (a
  vtable, string, global or function). Declare it (`extern void* DAT_004fd458[];`,
  a string literal, `extern Class_x DAT_00528a78;`) and use the name. The
  checker rejects hard-coded addresses.
- **`g_game` (0x511de8) is a pointer**: `mov eax, [0x511de8]` loads it, then
  fields are read at `[eax+N]`. Declare `extern char* g_game;` (or a struct
  pointer) and write `*(int*)(g_game + N)`. Never `&DAT_00511de8 + N`: that is a
  constant address with no load, and can never match.
- **`mov ecx, <global>; jmp <method>`**: a tail call of a method on a global
  object. Declare the object (`extern Class_x DAT_00528a78;`) and write
  `DAT_00528a78.FUN_004e1650();`. See `src/unsorted/0x4de0f0.cpp`.
- **Locals in parameter slots**: MSVC 5 reuses the stack slot of a parameter
  that is no longer needed for a local. When the code writes into a
  parameter's slot (a buffer, an output value), declare an ordinary local and
  the compiler puts it there itself.
- **Keeping a narrow computation where it is**: if the original computes
  `add cl, 0x3f; shl cl, 2` before a test and yours folds it into the branch,
  compute it in separate statements on an `unsigned char` local
  (`h = n + 0x3f; h <<= 2;`).
- **Search loops ending in `or reg, -1` then `cmp reg, -1`**: an inlined
  helper returning an index or -1. Write it as a `static inline` function with
  an early `return i;`.
- **`xor eax, eax` then a byte/word load into `al`/`ax`**: declare
  `unsigned int result = 0;` before the load and assign into it
  (`result = *(unsigned char*)p;`). A plain `return *(unsigned char*)p;` loads
  with a different register choice.
- **Global object vs. pointer**: `mov ecx, <addr>` passes the address of a
  global object (`extern Class_x DAT_...;`, call with `.`); `mov ecx, [<addr>]`
  loads a global pointer (`extern Class_x* DAT_...;`, call with `->`). The
  same goes for vtables and tables: storing the address itself needs an array
  declaration (`extern void* DAT_...[];`).
- **Never add your own `if (n > 0)` guard around a loop**: MSVC rotates a plain
  `for` loop into test-at-bottom form and adds that single guard itself; a
  guard in the source makes the test appear twice.
- **A pointer chain loaded after an index multiply** (`[edx + eax + disp]`,
  with `obj->a->b` read after `i * size` is computed): wrap the chain in a
  `static inline` getter and index its result, `GetEntries(obj)[i].field`.
- **Embedded structs at odd offsets**: a struct embedded at an offset that is
  not a multiple of 4 needs `#pragma pack(push, 2)` (or 1) on the outer struct.
  A `mov eax, edx; cmp eax, K` right after a store means the source re-reads
  the field it just assigned (typical inside an inline method on that struct).
- **Structs returned by value**: a callee returning a struct has a hidden first
  argument (the return buffer), so `ctx.py` shows one more argument dword than
  it really has, and a function that returns a struct returns `eax` = that
  pointer. Declare the real return type (`Vec3 __stdcall f(Obj*, int)`).
- **Structs passed by value**: a plain struct is pushed dword by dword; a class
  with a user-defined copy constructor is built in place
  (`sub esp, 8; mov eax, esp; mov [eax], ...`).
- **Callee types**: when a callee already has a name, look for its file in
  `src/unsorted/` and copy its parameter types (for example a `char`
  parameter), since they decide how arguments are prepared.
- **Bit tests**: a single-bit test on a byte folds to `test byte ptr [m], mask`;
  `shr reg, N; test al, 1` means a bitfield in a wider (`int`) field. Setting
  a bit in a dword bitfield is `mov eax, [m]; or al, K; mov [m], eax`.
- **`abs()`**: the `cdq; xor eax, edx; sub eax, edx` idiom is `abs()` from
  `<stdlib.h>`; a hand-written `if (x < 0) x = -x;` compiles differently.
- **Rewriting an inline helper changes the caller**: making a helper's body
  work on a local copy instead of its parameter changes register allocation
  elsewhere in the calling function, not just inside the inlined code. Try
  both spellings of a helper even when the difference looks local (#5168,
  0x462f30).
- **Where a goto-only block lands**: a block reached only by `goto` (an
  `error:` tail, say) is placed straight after the loop that jumps to it,
  unless it is the `else` arm of an `if`. If the original puts it at the end,
  look for an if/else spelling (#5168, 0x462f30).
- **`delete` and `new char[]` versus `operator delete` and `operator new`**:
  the expression forms shift the temporary-register rotation by one compared
  with calling the operator functions directly, so swap between them when
  every later temporary is one register off (#5168).
- **An early return in an inline helper counts in the frame sort**:
  `if (id == -1) return 10;` followed by the loop compiles to the same code as
  an if/else, but the frame sort counts the inlined result once more. In
  0x453d40 that put all 83 frame slots in place (#5171).
- **A real header before dummy declarations**: when register pairs in
  addresses are swapped throughout a function, or one store changes with the
  declaration count, try the headers the original TU plausibly included.
  `<windows.h>` with `WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN` fixed every swapped pair in
  0x453d40, and `<memory.h>` moved the count back to where its last store
  matched (that store repeats with period 16 in the count) (#5171).
- **Start from the cleaner file**: when an older, plainer version scores a
  little lower than a permuter-tuned one, rebuild from the plainer one.
  0x453d40 matched from a 63.3% file, not the 68.9% one (#5171).
- **x87: a constant multiply moved outward takes the sign of the sum**: VC5
  reassociates `x * 30.0f * field` to `(x * field) * c` and then rewrites
  `(int)(...) + a` as `a - (int)(... * -c)`. A float local for the product
  with the constant keeps the constant inside. How the integer sum is split
  into statements decides the division's operand order (`fidiv` against
  `fild; fild; fxch; fdivp`) and `fimul` against `fild; fmulp`, so try
  splitting the sum (`t = (int)(...) + 1; t += field;`) before blaming the
  float part (0x411f50, #5172).
- **Tracing the temporaries' rotation**: breaking on FUN_00435c37 (tuple in
  edx, its line delta at `[edx+0x10]`, rotating pointer at 0x491120) and
  FUN_00435f38 (register in ecx) lists every expression temporary with the
  pointer before it, so you can see whether a source change moves the
  rotation at all before scoring it (#5172).
- **Positive bitfield tests on one flags word**: `if (p->flags.visible) { if
  (... == p->flags.colored) ...` on an `unsigned short` bitfield loads the byte
  once and reuses the register for the second test, one more step of the
  eax/ecx/edx rotation than a `char` local or mask tests. The rotation restarts
  at a loop head, so a rotation fix has to be inside the loop (0x459830, #5178).
- **A zeroing store in a loop becomes `rep stosd`**: `weight[k] = 0;` in the
  body is turned into a `rep stosd` placed after the loop's pointer set-up, so
  those pointers live across it and lose ecx/edi/eax. A `memset` before the
  loop does not do that. If the original's loop-pointer `lea`s sit before a
  `rep stosd` and the pointers land in esi/ebx, look for a zeroing store in the
  loop (0x459c70, #5178).
- **A memory counter stepping by a constant** (`shade += 3`, zeroed after the
  loop guard) can be MSVC's strength reduction of `k * 3` in the body
  (0x459c70).
- **A walking pointer copied from another pointer is rebased**: `Vec3* v =
  verts;` is rebased to the field it reads last (`lea reg, [verts + 8]`);
  giving it its own read (`Vec3* v = list->pieces[p].vertices;`) keeps it
  unbiased (0x459c70).
- **`extern float` declaration order sets x87 operand order**: in a sum of
  products of globals, the product with the later-declared global is loaded
  first; the set of headers moves it too (0x459c70).
- **A load between a test and its jump can come from both arms**: MSVC hoists
  an identical first load out of both arms of an if/else to just before the
  `je` (0x459830).
- **An empty statement that emits no code can still decide a byte**: the last
  difference in 0x459c70 went with one `do {} while (0);` in a loop body
  (`if (0) {}` works too), most likely a debug macro that compiled to nothing.
  Try one in each loop when a single register or byte is left and the
  structure is right, and keep it with a comment if it matches (#5178).
- **A `mov reg, reg` copy is not always a CSE use**: C2's code generator
  remembers which register holds a value loaded from memory along the
  fall-through path, so a later read of the same field becomes `mov ecx, esi`
  although the IL reads memory. Check c2prio's reference lines before
  treating such a copy as a use of a temporary: in 0x47d2e0 the copy is a
  read through `los`, not a use of the width. A jump target is not tracked,
  so the same read there stays a memory operand (#5188).
- **x87 interleaving stops when a block passes a frame address to a call**:
  in small tests, MSVC 5 interleaves independent x87 computations only while
  the same basic block passes no frame address to a call, and a
  struct-returning call's hidden return buffer counts as one. So structs
  passed by address or returned by value in the block keep the float code
  sequential. 0x421700's original interleaves despite such calls, which no
  spelling has reproduced yet (#5199).
- **A split piece with no references is skipped**: once C2 splits a
  candidate, a long piece of it that has no references (spill cost 0) gets no
  register, and a neighbour's piece takes that register for the stretch. In
  0x462f30, `entry`'s piece from `entry = 0` to the route is skipped, so `net`
  takes edi there. Give that piece a reference, or shorten it, before chasing
  priorities (#5203).
- **Definition order can change how candidates split together**: not every
  register difference is a priority tie. In 0x463790, defining x first made
  C2 split n, remaining, left and `this` together, so remaining's piece won
  ebp. Defining i, progress, q and then x made them run out of registers one
  at a time, as in the original. Check c2prio's split column when a reorder
  moves several registers at once (#5203).
- **A global may be a file-scope `static`**: 0x4223e0 went from 65.9% to a
  match by declaring `DAT_00511fb4` `static` in its file, after which a plain
  `delete` matched. progress.py then names the address after the compiled
  static (`DAT_00511fb4$S4411`), so a second file using the same static may
  need a data/aliases.csv row (#5184).
- **Local declaration order sets operand order in sums**: `Gadget *grid,
  *gadgets;` rather than the reverse gave 0x4ac8c0's prologue sums the
  original's operand order. The match is sensitive to the declaration count
  (one extra `extern int` before it drops it to 91.5%) (#5207).
- **Reload order after a split follows candidate ids**: when C2 splits
  several values around a region, they are reloaded after it in the order of
  their candidate ids (the `id` column of `tools/c2prio.py`). To change the
  order, change which value the IL meets first: in 0x4b91b0, dropping a named
  `double g` and writing its expression at both uses renumbered the pieces
  into the original's order (#5235). In 0x4c0820, deleting a `count > 0` guard
  flips the order, which proves the cause, though the guard is in the original
  (#5225).
- **A jump to a different address can hide misplaced calls**: in 0x48ad30
  three calls sat outside an `if` they belong in, and the checker showed only
  a jump target that differed. When a jump's target is the only difference,
  compare the blocks on each side of it (#5249).
- **An argument slot read once can be an unassigned local**: a parameter's
  stack slot read once (`mov reg, [esp+N]`, never stored) while the parameter
  itself lives in a register everywhere else can be an uninitialised local
  that MSVC homed in that parameter's dead argument slot. Leave the variable
  unassigned on that path (0x419be0, after about 150 failed spellings of
  `cond ? x : button`; see docs/bugs.md) (#5276).
- **`add eax, 0x1c` then `[eax+4]` and `[eax]` is an inlined method on a
  sub-object**: write it as a method (`paths->grid.At(x, y)`). In 0x418310
  that, with two load-sharing fixes, went from 55.5% to 91.5% and fixed a frame
  layout ten earlier passes had blamed on the slot sort (#5276).
- **Choosing headers by batch**: when operand order depends on the
  declaration count, first scan dummy `extern int` counts in a scratch copy to
  see whether any count matches, then score pairs of real CRT headers in one
  batch with tools/propose.py (7 of 136 pairs matched 0x418310). Commit only
  the real headers (#5276).
- **Retest a /Gi partial without /Gi after structural fixes**: 0x418310 scored
  higher with /Gi as a partial but matched without it, like its neighbours
  (#5276).
- **A dead `mov eax, ecx` can be an inline helper's unused return value**:
  in 0x4bd160 it was the return of the `Grow` helper from the matched
  0x4bd3b0, called for its side effect (#5312).
- **A reload at the head of a block can be a split value from a helper taking
  a reference**: 0x4b5510's GDI cleanup is an inline helper that takes the DC
  by reference, and the original's reload is the split value coming back
  (#5315).
- **Load order in a product can follow the bases' symbol ids**: in 0x466dc0
  MSVC ordered the two loads of the x multiply by their bases' symbol ids, but
  only once `u->type` was read through `UnitType*& type = u->type;`. The full
  `<windows.h>` then gave the right ids; check them with
  `tools/c2prio.py --symbols` (#5308).
- **A tail written in both arms is merged but still moves the rotation**: in
  0x499200 the three-statement tail appears at the end of both arms of an
  if/else. MSVC merges the copies back into one, but compiling the then arm's
  copy moves the eax/ecx/edx rotation two steps before the else arm (#5331).
- **List-tail appends**: `if (tail) { tail->next = e; tail = e; } else tail =
  e;` compiles to the same code as the shorter forms but tips the register
  priorities differently; with `j++` once in the loop latch it matched
  0x461fd0 (#5318).
- **Keep notes above the annotation**: put comments before the
  `// FUNCTION:` line, not between it and the definition.

## Library and STL idioms (write the call, not the loop)

MSVC inlines these, so the disassembly shows a loop, but the source was a
single call:

- **`strcmp`**: a byte-compare loop unrolled by 2 ending in
  `sbb eax, eax; sbb eax, -1`. `memcmp`: `repe cmpsb` after `xor edx, edx`.
  `strlen`: `repne scasb` with `or ecx, -1`. Call the function with
  `const char*` arguments.
- **`vec.empty()`**: `sete al; ... and eax, 0xff` on a value that is 0 when
  `_First` is null, else `(_Last - _First) / sizeof(T)`.
- **`vector::erase(first, last)` out of line**: `eax` = the first argument, and a
  dead `mov [esp+8], <old _Last>` just before `ret 8` (left by the inlined
  `_Destroy`). See `src/unsorted/0x40cfb0.cpp` and `0x40c9f0.cpp`. For vectors of
  pointers, define the pointed-to struct (MSVC 5's `<xmemory>` needs it).
- **`while (n--)`**: `mov esi, ecx; dec ecx; test esi, esi; je`, then
  `lea esi, [ecx+1]` inside the guarded block.
- **Widened returns**: `and eax, 0xff` before `ret`, after a `sete al` or a
  byte loaded into `al`, means the function returns `int` holding a `bool` or
  `unsigned char`; the return type is `int`.

## When your version is "more optimised" than the original

It never is. If MSVC merges two branches, hoists a load, rotates a loop or
peels an iteration that the original didn't, the original source contained
something the optimiser saw early that leaves no trace in the final code.
Look for it instead of blaming the compiler:

- **Re-check the semantics first.** An off-by-one start (scanning from
  `strlen(s)`, not `strlen(s) - 1`) or a return value you dropped can look
  exactly like an optimisation difference.
- **Paths kept apart that you merge**: give them different return values
  (`return 0;` costs nothing when `eax` already holds 0), or add a no-op
  conversion; with x87 code a `(float)` cast of a double emits nothing but
  changes operand order and stops a load being hoisted.
- **A loop tested at the top with a `jmp` back from every branch**: the loop
  condition was an inlined helper with one `return` per outcome
  (`static inline int NotDone(...) { if (a == b) return 0; return 1; }`).
  A plain `while` gets rotated and its identical branches merged.
- **A global "vector" whose atexit destructor has no destroy loop** (no
  `push ecx`/dead store): a vector-shaped custom container, not `std::vector`.
  See `src/unsorted/0x438450.cpp` and `0x438480.cpp`.

## Saving check.py runs

The per-function budget in your instructions counts real attempts. Scoring a
scratch file with `uv run tools/check.py <addr> <scratch.cpp> --sym <name>`
(or checkall.py) is cheap and fine to repeat; there is no need to write your
own objdump-normalising diff script, since check.py's diff already masks
addresses.

Several agents work at once, so keep scratch files in your own folder:
`build/scratch/<your first address>/` (for example `build/scratch/0x4635b0/`),
never a shared name like `/tmp/a.cpp`.

`tools/wcl /c /O2 /Ob2 /MT /Fa<file>.asm /Fo<file>.obj <file>.cpp` compiles a scratch file
and writes an assembly listing you can read directly; iterate that way, then
confirm with one `check.py` run. `uv run tools/checkall.py <addr> <addr> ...` checks many
functions at once (in parallel, one summary line each), which suits a batch of
small functions.
- **Empty functions called with a format string** are debug-print stubs whose
  body was compiled out: declare and define them variadic,
  `void FUN_x(const char* fmt, ...)`.
- **A function that "writes `*p = x`" but keeps `p` out of `eax` until the
  end** returns `p` (`return p;`), like an assignment operator.
- **Windows API calls** (`call [0x4fc0e0]` that `ctx.py` labels "import Sleep from
  KERNEL32.dll"): include `<windows.h>` (or `<mmsystem.h>` for sound APIs) and
  call the function normally. Never declare an import slot as a `DAT_` global;
  the checker knows every import by name.
- **Calls through a game global holding a function pointer** (`call [DAT_x]`
  where `DAT_x` is not an import): declare it with its real type,
  `extern void (__stdcall* DAT_x)(int);`, and call through it. A table of them
  is an array of function pointers.
- **A call through a vtable** (`mov eax, [ecx]; call [eax+N]`) is a C++
  virtual call: declare a class with virtual methods (N/4 slots) and call the
  method; a hand-cast function pointer moves `this` to the wrong register.

## The STL and C++ exceptions

Cavedog compiled without `/GX` (no C++ exception handling), and so does the
checker. Use the real MSVC 5 STL headers (`<vector>`, `<map>`, `<string>`,
`<list>`): a local `std::_Lockit` or a `std::string` compiles without an
exception frame, exactly as in the original. Code from the C++ library itself
(`std::string` internals, `_Lockit`, the std exception classes) is marked
`library` in `data/functions.csv` and needs no decompiling; call it by its real
name (`std::_Lockit::_Lockit` is 0x4e39b0).
- **Arguments loaded in the wrong order or registers**: copy them into locals
  just before the call; the order of those copies decides which load MSVC
  hoists.
- **A pointer stored, offset, and stored again** (`lea ecx, [eax+K]; mov [..], ecx;
  add ecx, esi`): use one pointer local updated with `+=`; two separate
  expressions let MSVC fold the offset into a fresh `lea`.
- **A callee whose result is used as a full `int`** even though its own file
  returns `unsigned short`/`char`: declare it returning `int` in your file (the
  checker compares names, not types); the narrower type adds a mask the
  original lacks.
- **Forcing a field to be re-read**: MSVC 5 reuses an already-loaded field only
  when it is read through the same pointer temporary. When the original
  re-reads fields it just tested, compute the pointer again into a second local
  (`q = &g_game->players[i];`).
- **Negative `this` offsets** (`[ecx-8]`) in a function with no direct callers:
  it overrides a virtual function of a non-primary base class, and `this` points
  at that base subobject. Write the real multiple-inheritance class.
- **Function-local statics**: a guard-byte test, a constructor call on a global,
  then `atexit` of an empty function is `static T x(args);` inside the function,
  where `T` has an empty inline destructor.
- **Two copies of one function**: the exe links two identical copies of
  `std::_Lockit` (0x4e39b0 and 0x4e1480). `data/aliases.csv` lists such
  duplicates, and the checker accepts either address for the name.
- **Base constructor inlined into a derived constructor**: a store to a field
  (e.g. +4) before the vtable store is the base's inline constructor (its own
  vtable store is dead and disappears), followed by the derived class storing
  its vtable. Declare the base constructor inline in the class
  (see `src/unsorted/0x44d010.cpp`).
- **Freeing and zeroing several {_First,_Last,_End} triples, last member first**:
  the empty destructor of a class with `std::vector` members.
- **A per-element call inside an inlined vector destroy loop**: the element type
  has a destructor that makes that call; write the element class with
  `~Elem() { FUN_x(this); }` (or, as in `0x434020.cpp`, an overload of
  `std::_Destroy` for the element type).
- **Copy matched siblings first**: look for already-matched neighbours that use
  the same inlined helper and copy it verbatim; small phrasing differences
  (`int r = f(); if (!r)` vs `if (!f())`) change the whole function's registers.
- **Two ways to write `== 0`**: `return x == 0 ? 1 : 0;` gives
  `xor edx, edx; test; sete dl; mov eax, edx`; `return x == 0;` gives
  `neg; sbb; inc`. `neg; sbb; neg; dec` (0 or -1) is `return p ? 0 : -1;`.
- **Zero-init order**: a chained `a = b = c = d = 0;` initialises right to left.
- **Operand order that nothing changes**: only when the single remaining
  difference is which of two loads in one commutative `a + b` (or `x ^ y`) comes
  first, and you have tried swapping operands, helpers and the header block
  below, is the cause compiler state from earlier functions in the original
  file; say so and move on. This is rare. Ordinary register differences
  (a different register for a value, different instruction order elsewhere)
  are almost always fixable from the source: keep using the techniques above.
  Never add unused code to change the compiler state.
- **Operand order that no rewrite changes can depend on the headers**: which
  operand of a commutative integer or x87 operation MSVC loads first can depend
  on how many declarations the file has seen. If nothing else works, try
  including the headers a real game file would have
  (`<windows.h>`, `<stdio.h>`, `<string.h>`, `<math.h>`) at the top. There was no
  single header set shared by every file, so only add them where they help.
- **A fresh loop variable**: when an inlined helper shifts array entries down
  from index `i` and the original copies `i` into a new register before the
  loop, write `for (int j = i; ...)`; reusing the parameter swaps which
  register holds the counter and which the destination pointer.
- **Struct copy vs field copies**: assigning a whole 16-byte struct member
  emits `lea eax, [esi+8]` and stores relative to `eax`; four field assignments
  give direct `[esi+8]..[esi+0x14]` stores.
- **Families of functions**: look for matched functions of the same shape (for
  example the pool allocators 0x4ddce0/0x4ddc00: GlobalAlloc 0x2000 plus the
  out-of-memory handler) and copy them, changing only sizes and globals.
- **Inlined `std::map::find`**: declare the lower-bound callee as returning a
  node pointer and wrap it in a small iterator class (returning the iterator by
  value adds a hidden return pointer). `cmp; sbb; neg; test al, al` needs a
  `less`-style functor with `bool operator()`; `(p == End() || cmp(...)) ? End() : p`
  gives the `lea eax, [temp]` selection. See `src/unsorted/0x46e330.cpp`.
- **Assigning to a 1-bit bitfield**: an `int` value gives `xor/and 1/xor`; a
  `char` value gives `and/or`.
- **An argument `push` in the middle of a run of field stores**: MSVC hoists the
  push to just after the last inlined constructor before the call, so the stores
  before it came from member objects' inline constructors. Split those fields
  into member structs with inline constructors (see `0x4635b0.cpp`).
- **The same argument setup on both sides of a branch, then a jump to one
  call**: the source called one inlined helper in both branches of an if/else
  and MSVC merged the tail. A ternary argument gives a single push sequence.
- **Calls into "gap" regions** (hand-written assembly, e.g. the fixed-point trig
  routines at 0x4b70a0-0x4b7200): run `ctx.py` on the gap start to read the
  routine, take argument types from it (`movsx` of a word means `short`), and
  declare it `__cdecl FUN_<addr>`.
- **DirectX**: `<ddraw.h>`, `<dsound.h>` and `<dplay.h>` are available; a COM
  call (`call [ecx+N]` with the interface pointer pushed) is the real interface
  method, e.g. `IDirectDrawPalette::SetEntries`. The toolchain's `<dplay.h>` only
  has DirectX 3's `IDirectPlay`; the game's `IDirectPlay2`/`3` calls (e.g.
  `SetPlayerData` +0x74, `EnumConnections` +0x8c) need the interface declared by
  hand with padding slots, as in `0x4ca250.cpp` and `0x4c9d30.cpp`.
- **Siblings first**: unnamed functions next to a matched one often differ only
  in a string literal or a constant (a "METAL" version next to an "ENERGY"
  one), so check neighbouring addresses in `src/unsorted/` before starting.
- **Registers swapped in `base + index * size`**: try writing the full
  `obj->a->arr[i].field` expression each time it is used; a shared
  `Entry* e = &...[i]` local or getter changes which register holds the base.
- **Read constants from the exe** to learn what a function does, e.g. a 16-byte
  `.rdata` value compared with `memcmp` may be a DirectPlay service-provider GUID.
- **Scalar deleting destructors** (call the destructor, `operator delete(this)`
  if `flag & 1`, return `this`): call the destructor by its real name,
  `((Base*)this)->~Base();`, so it agrees with the destructor's own file.
- **Sizes pushed to `new` that are not multiples of 4** (e.g. 0x36): the class
  needs `#pragma pack(push, 2)` or MSVC rounds `sizeof` up.
- **The STL source is local**: `toolchain/msvc5-sp3/INCLUDE/XTREE`, `VECTOR`,
  `XSTRING` and friends show exactly where locks and helpers sit in inlined STL
  code (e.g. `lower_bound` is `iterator(_Lbound(k))`, and `_Lbound` takes the lock).
- **A parameter loaded into `ecx` early, with other registers used for the
  pointer chain**: a later callee is a `__thiscall` method on that parameter,
  even when `ecx` is set long before the call.
- **Adjacent `a += b` field updates whose last store is not sunk past a later
  load**: an inlined `operator+=` on an embedded vector struct.
- **Lazy singletons**: `if (!g) g = new T; return g;`. A failed-allocation path
  doing `xor eax, eax; mov [g], eax` means the global is returned; a
  `GlobalAlloc` null check around constructor stores is `new` with a class
  `operator new` (see `0x4da9f0.cpp`).
- **A small struct field stored to the stack and re-read as a dword before an
  add**: C-style inline helpers that take and return the struct by value
  (`MakePoint(x, y)`, `AddPoints(a, b)`), not constructors and `operator+=`.
- **`mov al, [m]; shr al, N; test al, 1` at an odd offset**: an `unsigned short`
  bitfield whose storage starts there, in a packed struct.
- **A parameter pointer loaded before the first branch** while yours loads it
  in each branch: take a reference to the field at the top
  (`int& m = obj->field;`).
- **Two pushes merging into one call** (`push edx; jmp L` / `L0: push imm` /
  `L: push ...; call`): an if/else calling the same function in both branches
  with one argument different.
- **Scalar deleting destructors that free through a pool** instead of
  `operator delete`: call the pool object's method (see `0x471cd0.cpp`).
- **Register priority**: when MSVC gives the preferred callee-saved register to
  the wrong variable, the original may have used the other variable once more
  in a way that folds away (e.g. an inlined sibling getter with its own range
  check inside an identical explicit check). A throwaway extra use in a scratch
  copy confirms the diagnosis; then find the natural construct, never commit
  the throwaway.
- **A callee that starts `mov eax, ecx` and ends `ret N`** is a method, usually a
  constructor, even if your call site happens to leave the right value in
  `ecx`. Declaring it as a free function can still produce matching bytes, but
  gives it a wrong name that later callers trip over.
- **Protected STL members out of line** (e.g. `vector::_Ucopy`): derive a struct
  from the container and initialise a static member pointer inside it,
  `Fn Access::fn = &Access::_Ucopy;`.
- **`or byte ptr [m], K` straight to memory** is setting a 1-bit
  `unsigned short` bitfield; `unsigned char` bitfields go through a register.
- **Loops with several induction variables**: which one MSVC compares against
  the end follows the order the per-iteration pointer locals are computed.
- **Bitfield test polarity**: `if (!bitfield)` compiles to
  `test byte ptr [m], mask`, while `if (bitfield)` (including
  `if (bitfield) return;`) gives `mov reg, [m]; shr reg, N; test reg, 1`.
- **x87 results stored back into argument slots** (`fstp [esp+0xc]`) before being
  copied to a return buffer: the argument is a struct passed by value
  (`Vec3 f(Vec3 v)`).
- **x87 loads one step early in a sum of squares**: compute each product into
  its own float local first.
- **When a match needs the function before it compiled first** (a loop guard
  gets its own copy of a call, or a tail merge differs, only in a file with no
  earlier function): define the real preceding function (`ctx.py` on the
  address just before yours) in the same file, above yours. That is how the
  original file was laid out, so it is not a trick; never define made-up
  functions for this. See `src/unsorted/0x4b0830.cpp`. If that function
  already has its own file under `src/`, define it **without** a
  `// FUNCTION:` line: an address annotated in two files stops the progress
  check ("duplicate of"). 0x43f0e0 (copying 0x43e490), 0x49b720 (0x49b6e0)
  and 0x4a7960 (0x4a7830) all matched or moved this way on 2026-10-02.
- **Ordinal-only imports** (DPLAYX, smackw32) are called through `jmp [iat]`
  thunks; declare the real API with `extern "C" ... __stdcall`.
- **Calling a constructor callee on `this` first, then copying fields and
  returning `this`**: a copy constructor of a class whose first member has that
  constructor. Write it with a member-initialiser list,
  `X::X(const X& o) : handle(o.handle), a(o.a) {}`; a constructor cannot be
  called through a pointer. See `src/unsorted/0x437820.cpp` and `0x4b7e30.cpp`.
- **Ordinal imports called directly** (`call [iat]` into smackw32 or DPLAYX):
  declare the real API as `extern "C" __declspec(dllimport) ... __stdcall`;
  `Original().pe.DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT` shows which DLL and ordinal a slot holds.
- **`sete` after a call**: `return x == 0 ? 1 : 0;` gives `sete` only when `x`
  is a local; applied to a call result it folds to `neg/sbb/inc`, so store the
  result in an `int` first.
- **Function-local statics** (`static T x(...);` inside a function, with its
  `$S1` guard) are file-local names: the checker never compares them with
  other files, so name them naturally.
- **A byte local widened through its stack slot** (`mov [esp+X], cl;
  mov edx, [esp+X]; and edx, 0xff`) is an `unsigned char` local used in more
  than one basic block; index loops (`for (i = 0; text[i]; i++) { unsigned char
  c = text[i]; ... }`) give that shape where pointer-walking loops do not.
- **Avoid `volatile`**: a store that looks dead, often with a `push ecx`
  reserved slot, usually comes from inlined STL code (the destroy loop of a
  `std::vector` of a trivial type leaves exactly that). Try the real STL
  construct first; `volatile` is a last resort that Cavedog almost certainly
  did not write. A loop whose body compiles to nothing
  (`for (i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {}`) also leaves just the store of its
  counter's first value (0x458d20). An explicit member destructor call works
  as `member.~vector();` (MSVC 5 rejects `~TypedefName()`).
- **Check whether the caller uses `eax`**: when the original keeps a value in
  `eax` (or avoids `eax` in a loop and pushes `ebx` instead), the function
  probably returns that value; look for `mov reg, eax` after a call site.
  Returning it fixed 0x4d0c10 and 0x4800c0.
- **A `(float)` cast on a difference** can decide how a float struct result is
  copied to the return buffer, not just x87 order (0x4b6f70).
- **Placement-new copies with a null check** (`test esi, esi; je` then a copy
  constructor call on `esi`, `ret 8`) are `std::allocator<T>::construct`; emit
  it out of line by taking its address (see 0x432cf0.cpp).
- **Naming a vtable from RTTI**: the dword before a vtable points to the RTTI
  locator; locator +0xc points to the type descriptor, whose ".?AV...@@" string
  names the class. `<stdexcept>` classes are emitted by a static object of the
  class (see 0x4c38f0.cpp).
- **Zeroing a fixed int array**: a `for` loop gives `mov ecx, N; lea edi; xor
  eax, eax` for `rep stosd`; `memset` puts `xor eax, eax` before the `lea`.
- **An int call result stored into a `bool`**: `x ? true : false` gives
  `test eax, eax; setne al`; `x != 0` and `(bool)x` give `neg; sbb; neg`.
- **`fsub qword [-1.0]`** is `f += 1.0` (MSVC 5 adds 1.0 by subtracting -1.0).
- **A function that opens with a copy of a recursive callee's body**: `/Ob2`
  inlined one level of the recursion; write that level out by hand.
- **A `??_G` with the destructor inlined**: give the class an inline virtual
  destructor and add a static object whose constructor is only declared; MSVC
  then emits the vtable and the `??_G` (see 0x470ae0.cpp). Annotate the atexit
  destructor of a global as `_$E2` next to its `_$E4` (see 0x44f720.cpp).
- **Ghidra's return value can be a leftover**: when `eax` only holds what a
  final `idiv` or call left there and no caller reads it (`called from 0
  place(s)`, or callers ignore `eax`), the function returns `void` (0x47a8e0:
  `*p = (*p + 1) % n;`, not a quotient and remainder pair).
- **A pointer computed into `ecx` before a float argument's `push ecx; fstp
  [esp]`, then pushed again as an argument**: the callee is a `__thiscall`
  method called on that pointer (0x41bd10).
- **A parameter loaded after `operator new` that the original loads before**:
  bind a reference to the global slot first (`T*& slot = arr[i]; slot = new
  T(i);`), as in 0x40b320.
- **Dead sums in a loop**: MSVC 5 keeps unused accumulations inside loops;
  write them as unused locals rather than looking for a consumer.
- **A dead `lea reg, [base+K]` next to stores at `[base+K+n]`**: a struct
  pointer local (`S* p = &g_game->s; p->a = 0;`); MSVC folds the offsets into
  the stores but keeps the `lea` (0x4679a0).
- **An inlined `strcpy` whose destination `lea` sits between the `test` and the
  `je` choosing the source**: an if/else with one `strcpy` per branch, tail
  merged; a ternary source puts the `lea` after the merge (0x45ba60).
- **String arguments that are addresses of the function's own stack
  arguments**: a struct passed by value; a caller's `sub esp, K; rep movsd`
  gives its size (0x4d8790).
- **An out-of-line destructor (`??1`)** stores the derived vtable, runs the
  body, then stores the base vtable (the inlined base destructor). If the
  class's `??_G` already has a file, define the same destructor with its own
  `// FUNCTION:` line there or in a copy of that class declaration (0x4909e0).
- **Check a small batch before spending check.py runs**: compile every file in
  one `tools/wcl` loop and compare each object's `objdump -d --no-show-raw-insn`
  with ctx.py; mismatches show up before the first check.py run.
- **A constant hoisted into a register** (`mov eax, 1` then `test [m], al`)
  where the original uses immediates: put the final test and `return 1/0` in
  their own `static inline` helper (0x457a50).
- **Finding a class's layout from its destructor**: grep the disassembly for
  the vtable address to find the constructor's store site; the constructor
  shows where member arrays start (0x462d30).
- **Call order of `f() + g()`** (two calls without arguments): MSVC 5 calls
  the one declared later first, whatever the source order; reorder the
  declarations, not the expression (0x4468c0).
- **A float field spilled with `fld; fstp [esp+N]` before a call it is compared
  with**: that is a `min()`/`max()` macro. In `p->x < f()` MSVC 5 loads the
  field after the call, but the macro's parenthesised `(p->x) < (f())` loads
  it before and spills it. If the original also stores the result after the
  next call's constant pushes (`fild; push 0; push 1; fstp [field]`), cast the
  int argument explicitly: `__min(p->x, (float)f())`. Found by Claude Opus 5.5
  in #106 (0x419340, 0x419400).
- **`__DATE__`/`__TIME__` strings**: write the literals ("Jul 30 1998",
  "11:16:36"); the macros give today's date (0x41d920).
- **A hand-stored vtable** (`vtable = DAT_x;`) is a last resort: declare the real
  virtual slots with the names they already have (placeholder `FUN_` names in
  different classes are compatible) and let the constructor or destructor store
  it (0x43a1f0).
- **A derived class's `??_G` when its destructor is trivial**: the static
  object trick does not emit it (the derived vtable store is dead, so the
  vtable is never emitted). Define the real constructor again, unannotated, in
  the `??_G` file (0x44f590, 0x490840, 0x490630); see 0x44ef60.cpp for the
  whole family.
- **Variants in one scratch file influence each other**: earlier functions in a
  file change how later ones compile. Recompile the winning variant alone (or
  run tools/headers.py) before the check.py run (0x4c23e0).
- **Emitting a `std::vector` copy constructor out of line**: its address can't
  be taken, but the address of a member that calls it (the outer vector's
  `insert(iterator, size_type, const T&)`) works (0x434470).
- **A field load hoisted above stores the original keeps it after**: put the
  stores and the test in an inline method of a member sub-object (0x463610).
- **A 1-bit bitfield assigned from a byte parameter** (`mov bl, [esp+N]; and
  ebx, 1; shl`): the parameter is `int`; `char` gives `and bl, 1; movsx`.
- **A method with an established placeholder name that is really an out-of-line
  destructor**: write the named method as `((Real*)this)->Real::~Real();` with
  an inline destructor; MSVC inlines it with its vtable store (0x470b80).
- **A `bool` return from a call**: `return f() == 0 ? true : false;` gives
  `test eax, eax; sete al`; an int local first gives `xor edx, edx; sete dl;
  mov al, dl`, and `return f() == 0;` gives `neg; sbb; inc` (0x4de810).
- **Two parameters clamped through one reused stack slot**: a `static inline`
  clamp helper per value, not in-place changes to the parameters (0x496e90).
- **Two byte-identical out-of-line STL helpers**: the call site tells them
  apart; `ecx` set to the container means `allocator<T>::destroy`, no `ecx`
  means `std::_Destroy<T>` (0x434400).
- **A callee with one unused extra stack argument whose caller reads `[eax]`
  right after the call**: a postfix `operator++(int)` / `operator--(int)` on an
  STL iterator, returned through a hidden buffer (0x46fac0).
- **A byte constant hoisted as `mov dl, K`**: every use must be byte-typed;
  route the result through an `unsigned char` local (0x4897e0).
- **A tail returning K or 0 compiled branchless** (`setcc; dec; and`) where
  the original branches: give the zero case its own explicit `return 0;` before
  the final `return 0;` (0x480720).
- **`while (1)` vs `for (;;)`**: a loop that breaks in the middle stays tested
  at the top only as `while (1)`; MSVC 5 rotates `for (;;)` (0x4356f0).
- **A loop whose body reloads `*p` at the top and compares later bytes with a
  register constant**: the body was an inlined helper returning the new
  pointer, `while (*p) p = Helper(p);` (0x4c33a0).
- **`push ecx; mov ecx, esp; push x; call F` before the other pushes**: F
  constructs a by-value class argument in place; name it
  `Class_<F>::Class_<F>` (0x401c20).
- **A pointer-walking loop whose exit returns with a bare `ret`** (the pointer
  is already 0 in `eax`): `while (p) { if (...) return 1; p = p->next; } return
  0;`; `do/while` peels a copy of the body and `break` adds a `setne` (0x481430).
- **Constructor order**: MSVC 5 stores the vtable after the member
  initialisers and before the body, so stores before the vtable store are
  initialisers and stores after it are body assignments (0x407930).
- **A bitfield assigned from a call result**: `xor eax, ecx; and eax, 1; xor
  eax, ecx` in `eax` comes from an `int` local holding the result; assigning
  the call directly copies the old field into a callee-saved register (0x4ae410).
- **Indexing through a pointer field**: load the array pointer into a local
  before indexing (`Entry* entries = obj->entries; entries[i]`) when the
  original loads it before the multiply (0x4a0ff0).
- **A fill loop that looks like `rep stosd` plus a separate counter loop and a
  `lea edi, [base+cnt*4]`**: not `memset` but a plain loop such as
  `while (n >= 4) { *d++ = v; n -= 4; }`, which MSVC 5 converts (0x4d82c0).
- **Out-of-line `std::vector<T>::~vector`** (`push ecx`, free `_First`, zero the
  three pointers, called from element destroy loops): emit it by taking the
  address of the outer `vector<vector<T>>::operator=` (0x433a30).
- **`f(g(a), b)` pushes `b` before calling `g`**: when the original loads `b`
  after `g` returns, store `g`'s result in a local first (0x445e20).
- **`cmp edx, edx` plus a dead store of the old `_Last` into an argument
  slot**: an inlined `vector::clear()` (`erase(begin(), end())`) on that
  argument (0x44ce90).
- **An uncalled out-of-line constructor just before a class's destructor**: the
  class's `new` site inlines the same body elsewhere; reuse the class that
  inlined copy already has (0x470f80, 0x4402e0).
- **A `this`-less `__thiscall` range destroy** (`ret 8`, ecx unused, called with
  `mov ecx, vec` before an inlined `_Ucopy`/insert tail): `vector<T>::_Destroy
  (iterator, iterator)`, emitted like `_Ucopy` through a member pointer (0x4c5b70).
- **A derived class that overrides every slot of a base whose vtable has other
  names**: declare the derived slot names as the base's virtuals (the base
  vtable is never emitted in that file) so the derived constructor emits a
  correctly named vtable (0x474cd0).
- **`push 0; mov ecx, elem; call X` in a destroy loop**: X is the element's
  `??_G` with an implicit destructor, called only at one exact inline depth
  (one level shallower gives `??1T`). Probe the depth with wrapper structs in
  scratch; rebuilding the real caller in the same file emits it, and the
  rebuilt caller may match too (0x4c51b0 and 0x4c2eb0).
- **A `ret 0xc` copy loop that never reads `ecx` but whose callers set `ecx` to
  a vector**: `vector<T>::_Ucopy`, a member, not a `__stdcall` function; the
  caller pattern `push &local; push n; mov ecx, vec` is `vector::resize`
  (0x40d550, 0x40c7f0).
- **An inlined lock/acquire loop tested at the top**: the success case returns
  from inside a `while (1)`; breaking out or a try-helper condition rotates the
  loop (0x4c2b20).
- **A function forwarding an STL iterator through a temporary plus a copy**:
  the returned iterator type differs from the callee's (a `set`'s iterator is
  the tree's `const_iterator`, converted by a constructor); a same-type forward
  (`map`) builds the result straight into the return buffer (0x4dbd00).
- **A leaf method ending with the stored value already in `eax`**: it probably
  returns that value, even with no callers to show it (0x4b4c50).
- **In a constructor, `mov dl, [esp+4]` stored at +K and three zeroed dwords at
  K+4..K+0xc**: a default-constructed `std::vector` member; the byte is its
  empty allocator temporary in a dead parameter slot (0x480160).
- **Before declaring a class's virtuals**, dump its vtable with
  `objdump -s --start-address=<vtable> --stop-address=<vtable+0x40>
  orig/TotalA.exe` to see what each slot holds.
- **All divisions done before three stores to an output struct**: assign a
  constructed temporary, `*out = Vec3(a / n, b / n, c / n);`; field-by-field
  stores interleave with the divisions (0x407410).
- **`if (bf && x)` vs nested ifs**: `if (bf && x)` tests the bitfield with
  `test byte ptr [m], mask`; nested `if (bf) { if (x) ... }` gives `mov ax, [m];
  shr eax, N; test al, 1` (0x4c2cc0).
- **A byte difference used as an `unsigned short` index**: compute it into an
  `int` in its own statement; `(unsigned short)(c - f)` does 16-bit arithmetic
  (0x4c1480).
- **`mov reg, [0]`**: an inlined helper was passed a null pointer and reads a
  field through it, e.g. `Send(0, &packet)` (0x46d530).
- **A pointed-to field re-read around stores into a local buffer**: declare
  the local at function scope; its address escapes to a call, so MSVC treats it
  as aliased and keeps the re-reads (0x450f90).
- **One code shape repeated across functions**: search the exe disassembly for
  a distinctive immediate (such as `push 0xba`); the copies show it is an
  inlined helper and which parts are fixed.
- **Block layout that no reordering changes**: move the loop's match test and
  its body into separate `static inline` helpers (0x43afc0).
- **A narrowed index into a vector** (`_First` loaded before `dec; movsx;
  shl`): index a real `std::vector` member (`&v[(short)(n - 1)]`); a raw
  pointer field loads `_First` after the arithmetic (0x433500).
- **What callers do with a function**: `objdump -d -M intel orig/TotalA.exe |
  grep -B8 "call   0x<addr>"` shows whether they set ecx, what they push and
  what the object is.
- **The same tail call in both arms of an if/else**, seen as a `push` hoisted
  above the `je` in both arms: write the call in each arm; early returns
  falling through to one shared call do not reproduce it (0x408920).
- **A byte copy loop that increments the destination before the load** (`inc
  edx; mov al, [ecx]; ...; mov [edx-1], al`): read into an `unsigned int` local,
  then `*d++ = c;` (0x4587b0).
- **Loops over `g_game->players[i]`** with the walking pointer at the entry
  start and the byte compare constant in a register: take a per-iteration
  `Player* p = &g_game->players[i];` (0x457b90).
- **A field read and stored back unchanged between two real updates**
  (`mov edx, [esi+4]; mov [esi+4], edx`): a component-wise `out->y -= d.y`
  where `d.y` is a constant 0 from an inlined vector helper (0x44d720).
- **`or ecx, -1; repne scasb; not ecx` pushed with no `dec ecx`**:
  `strlen(s) + 1`, the length including the terminator (0x49e640).
- **Pass-through parameters** (only forwarded, pushed from a callee-saved
  register): declare them `int`; a narrower type changes which parameter gets
  `ebx` or `ebp` even with no extension code (0x4c07b0).
- **A byte field pushed as `mov cl, [m]; push ecx`**: the callee's parameter is
  char-typed; declare it so, since an `int` parameter adds `movzx`/`movsx`
  (0x47bd70).
- **Two callers deleting the same object at different inline depths** (one
  calls `??1T`, the other `??_GT`): rebuilding the deeper caller unannotated
  emits the `??_G` (0x470300).
- **Stores through a pointer to an array element computed after the multiply**
  (`i * size`, then the `obj->a->b` chain, then the add): pass `&obj->a->b[i]` to
  a `static inline` helper that does the stores; a local pointer loads the
  chain first (0x4a3eb0).
- **`rep movsd` from `lea esi, [eax+K]` right after a call**: `memcpy(dst,
  &p->field, n)`; a struct assignment gives `mov esi, eax; add esi, K`
  (0x4c2380).
- **A byte global used as an index and a compare, kept in `bl`**: read the
  global each time rather than copying it to a local, which gets spilled
  (0x48ffd0).
- **Loads through a copied register interleaved with adds before the stores**:
  a whole-struct copy then `+=` on some fields (`Rect r = *rect; r.y1 += dy;`),
  not field initialisers (0x467b60).
- **The same call twice with identical arguments in a compare-then-select**:
  a `max()`/`min()` macro evaluating its argument twice; write the macro
  (0x48a7f0).
- **`add reg, 0xffff; shl reg, 16` for `(n - 1) << 16`**: every integer spelling
  folds to `shl; sub reg, 0x10000`; copy a local 16.16 bitfield struct
  (`{unsigned frac : 16; int whole : 16;}`, frac = 0 then whole = n) instead
  (0x4853b0).
- **An in-place copy loop kept as two walking pointers** (`inc ecx; inc eax`):
  write it with two int indices into the one array, `do { p[k] = p[j]; k++; }
  while (p[j++]);`; pointer versions become an offset from the source
  (0x4bb150).
- **A constructor callee whose existing file declares the class smaller than
  the size pushed to `new`**: declare the class again locally with the right
  size and the same constructor signature (0x40f200).
- **Out-of-line pool allocators** (0x4dddf0, 0x4e2b60): declare `unsigned int
  rem = 0x2000;` before the GlobalAlloc retry loop, and pop with `p = DAT; DAT =
  *(void**)DAT;`.
- **`push 4; call operator new` then `if (p) *p = n`** with `n` a size: `new
  T(n)`, a scalar with an initialiser, not an array allocation (0x415bb0).
- **A zero register stored three times through a copy of the destination
  pointer** (`mov ebx, esi; mov [ebx], edi` x3): an inlined `memset(p, 0, 12)`;
  field-by-field zeroing gives immediate stores (0x485330).
- **A null test of `this`, then `lea reg, [this+K]` with the call tail on both
  paths**: `this` converted to a non-primary base; declare the real two-base
  class and pass `this` (0x48f200).
- **Headers can decide which side of a comparison is evaluated first**, not just
  operand order inside `+` or `*`; run tools/headers.py as soon as a whole
  subexpression comes out in the wrong order (0x4c1320).
- **A field compared and then re-read at once** with nothing stored between:
  the check and the use were inline methods of an embedded member struct,
  called as `member.Method()` (0x40d8b0).
- **One call after an if/else vs one in each arm**: MSVC duplicates a shared
  tail call into both arms itself; writing it in each arm changes the argument
  load order. Try both forms (0x4ab6c0 vs 0x408920).
- **Inline helpers taking structs by value**: arguments are evaluated right to
  left, so the parameter order decides which copy is loaded first (0x47ddc0).
- **Overloaded constructors**: names are compared without signatures, so a
  second constructor of an already named class needs a class named after its
  own address (0x4c91b0).
- **Choosing between two element models for an emitted `??_G`**: rebuild the
  caller that emits it and score it with `--sym`; the model whose caller also
  matches gives the right class (0x4349f0).
- **One `sub` after an if/else merge**: `x - K` written in both branches; a
  single subtraction after the merge becomes `add reg, -K` (0x4bc320).
- **`cmp eax, <reg known to be 0>` instead of `test eax, eax` after a call**: the
  result was stored in a local first (`hr = f(); if (hr == 0)`) (0x4c9dd0).
- **An immediate `mov [m], 0` among stores of zeroed registers**: that
  assignment came before the zero temporaries in the source (0x43d210).
- **A literal argument pushed as a register** right after a compare with that
  value: MSVC reused the register; the source still had the literal.
- **A call to a named method with no `mov ecx` before it** in a function that
  never sets ecx: the caller is a method of the same class and `this` passes
  through (0x437b50).
- **A table whose existing `DAT_` symbol starts at element 1**: `arr[k - 1]`
  keeps the offset in a separate `lea`; declare the true base as a new `DAT_`
  symbol and index it directly (0x415ef0).
- **Min-select `mov ecx, b; cmp; jae; mov ecx, a`**: the ternary names the value
  loaded first as its true branch (`a >= b ? b : a`) (0x4dba40).
- **A bitfield or boolean computed at 32 bits for a `char`-typed callee
  parameter**: declare that parameter `int` in your file (0x446450).
- **A zero constant in the wrong register while the early `return 0` has its own
  `xor eax, eax`**: hoist the pointer local the original computes earlier; its
  live range pushes the zero out of `eax` (0x437be0).
- **Inlined `std::set`/`map` operations whose helpers already have placeholder
  names**: write hand-rolled Iter/Find classes (as in 0x46e330). An 8-byte
  `pair<iterator, bool>` comes back through a hidden pointer only with a
  user-declared constructor (0x4e1990).
- **Two struct locals copied from pointers**: the first declared gets a real
  stack slot and the later one reuses a dead parameter slot; swap the
  declarations if they come out reversed (0x421eb0).
- **Destroying a `std::vector` member of each array element**: call
  `arr[i].member.~vector()` directly for `lea esi, [base+idx+K]`; the element's
  implicit destructor gives `add esi, idx` (0x4801f0).
- **`g_game->f += call() << k` when the original loads `g_game` after the
  call**: put the result in an int local first (0x416860).
- **Find near-copies before writing**: grep src/unsorted for a distinctive
  offset or callee address; many functions differ from a matched sibling only
  in a callee, a key string or a value type.
- **Victory-condition classes (vtables 0x4fd800-0x4fd978)**: each has a
  visitor (second-base) vtable just before its main one (main 0x4fd870, visitor
  0x4fd868); 0x4fd940 is the pure visitor base. Copy the two-base class and
  ForEach helper from 0x48edb0 or 0x48f530.
- **`Vec3 v; v = Vec3(0, 0, 0);`** gives three separate zero registers, the last
  store after the argument pushes; `Vec3 v(0, 0, 0);` or field zeroing shares
  one zero register (0x44eb60).
- **A free function whose callers set `ecx` just before calling it**: it is
  really a method that ignores `this` (0x4ce190, 0x461610). Check the callers
  before trusting a free-function name.
- **A negative-offset override (`[ecx-8]`)**: search .rdata for the function's
  address, then grep the disassembly for stores of that vtable; the
  constructor's store sequence names the owning class and the base offset
  (0x48f790).
- **A value loaded into `eax` then copied to a callee-saved register**: use the
  parameter itself as the loop variable and keep a copy of its old value
  (0x4a7560).
- **Before writing a constructor, find a sibling constructor of the same
  family** (grep for a distinctive expression such as `<< 19`) and copy its
  local-variable layout; it decides which stack slots MSVC reuses (0x44d3b0).
- **A placeholder method name that is really a constructor**: write the method
  as `((Real*)this)->Real::Real(args); return (Real*)this;` with an inline
  constructor (0x470a90); the destructor counterpart is 0x470b80.
- **A sum the original computes twice**: MSVC 5 shares `a + b` even across
  branches, so one use was probably two `+=` steps (`z += off; z += x1;`)
  (0x4c0a90).
- **Which field MSVC 5 walks an array loop from**: with no pointer local, the
  walking register starts at the second field the source accesses, so an
  unexpected `lea reg, [base+K]` shows which access came second (0x49d1e0,
  0x450980).
- **Identical `switch` cases may need separate bodies** even when the original
  has one shared target: writing cases 1 and 3 separately let MSVC merge their
  calls at the right place and fixed register choice around them (0x406780).
- **An inline helper that must reload a pointer member after each call**:
  take the pointer by reference (`Owner*& o`); passing it by value keeps it in
  a register (0x4077e0).
- **`lea reg, [esi+K]` then stores at `[reg+4]`/`[reg+8]`**: a struct copy into
  an inlined constructor's `this` (`*this = Vec3(...)`); field initialisers, a
  user `operator=` or a helper give direct `[esi+K]` stores. The scheduler folds
  the first store to `[esi+K]` only when nothing can fill the slot after the
  `lea`, so an unfolded `mov [reg], x` means other instructions came between
  them in the compiler's input (0x407d40).
- **`strlen(text) > 0 ? text : 0`** gives `cmp eax, ecx; sbb esi, esi` for a
  pointer-or-null select (0x435320).
- **Stack offsets of several local arrays**: they follow the order the code
  first writes them (zeroing order), not the declaration order (0x401360).
- **A 0/1 argument pushed on its own in each branch**: write the call in every
  branch with an `int ok` local rather than one call after the branches
  (0x401360).
- **A float constant that fails on the bytes after it** (our object pads it
  where the original's constant pool has the next constant): define the real
  preceding function in the same file, so its constants come first in the pool
  as in the original (0x402430 in 0x402640.cpp).
- **Passing a by-value class argument built from a literal**: write it
  implicitly (`FUN_0043adc0("PARK", ...)`), which constructs it in place on the
  stack; an explicit `Class_00438760("PARK")` makes a temporary and copies it.
- **A vector sum whose last coordinate comes out in the wrong register**: use a
  member `operator+` taking its operand by const reference, not a free helper
  (0x403a20).
- **64-bit widening that comes too early**: a `Vec3` subtraction followed by a
  member squared-distance helper postpones it until after the range
  calculation; separate scalar 64-bit locals widen too early (0x404730).
- **A 16-bit register copy (`mov bx, dx`) of a value stored later**: assign the
  values into the fields of a small struct local (`Point16 p; p.x = n % w;`) and
  copy them out afterwards; a plain `short` local gives `mov ebx, edx` (0x404db0,
  same shape at 0x423c50).
- **A box whose `hi.x` is stored twice**: `box.hi = box.lo;` then `+=` per field;
  separate field assignments drop the first store (0x404ad0).
- **A vector insertion that reuses a pointer parameter's stack slot**: pass a
  reference to that parameter as the element; copying the pointer into a
  separate element local adds a store (0x405d90, with the out-of-line
  `_Construct` FUN_00406c70).
- **A loop over the three weapons with a byte counter**: callee parameter types
  decide whether the counter stays a byte; an `unsigned char` argument keeps it,
  `int` arguments add a separate integer induction variable (0x406300,
  0x406f80).
- **A case whose call tail yours merges with other cases, but the original keeps
  separate** (with `mov ecx, this` before the last push): let that case `break`
  to a shared `x++; return 1;` after the switch instead of returning inside it.
  Cases that `return` inside the switch are cross-jumped at the call (0x4034a0).
- **A constant hoisted into a callee-saved register** (`mov ebx, 0x8000; test
  ebx, eax`) where the original uses `test ah, 0x80`: remove one source use,
  for example one shared `Wait(); return 2;` after an if/else-if, which MSVC
  duplicates into both arms itself (0x402da0).
- **Scratch registers rotated by one across a loop** (eax/ecx vs ecx/edx): MSVC 5
  hands them out in rotation, so the loop has one temporary more or fewer
  earlier on; two throwaway loads in a scratch copy confirm it (0x402da0).
- **Two locals swapped between callee-saved registers after a search helper**:
  try inverting the helper's early return (`if (i < 0) return 0;` versus
  `if (i >= 0) { ...; return e; } return 0;`) (0x45af90).
- **A field read twice where yours reads it once**: read it once through an
  inline method and once as a plain field (`health + def->MaxHealth()` over
  `def->maxHealth * 2`); two plain reads get merged (0x404270).
- **A constant folded into a reciprocal**: cast the helper's result
  (`return (float)(x * 30);`) so MSVC keeps the multiply (0x404270).
- **Constants: write literals, not `extern const float DAT_x`.** A literal
  lands in the constant pool as in the original; a declared global points at
  whatever address its name says, which must be exactly the original's.
- **A visitor object whose field and vtable stores come after the pushes, in its
  own frame slot**: pass it as a temporary by const reference,
  `FUN_0047e890(&unit->pos, range, Class_00405d90(owner, &units, unit))`
  (0x405980; the same call shape is at 0x410a9a and 0x4154e8).
- **x87 load order in `a >= b * 0.2`** depends on what else is in the basic
  block, not on how the comparison is written.
- **A zero kept in `ebp` after a loop, with duplicated call tails**: write each
  branch's tail out in full (its own `new`, call, stores and `return`) instead
  of one shared call after an if/else-if (0x406300).
- **An unused label can change the code**: in 0x406300, removing an unused
  `follow:` label lowered the score, so the original probably had a `goto`
  there. Keep labels that help.
- **A multiply by an odd constant as a `lea` chain versus `imul reg, imm`** can
  depend on the header set alone: 0x4b6c30's `seed * 16807` is a `lea` chain only
  with `<windows.h>` included.
- **Why headers matter at all: it is compiler state, not header content.** In
  0x4b6c30, replacing `<windows.h>` with 2700 to 5400 unused prototypes flips
  the same choice, while fewer or more do not. So operand order and register
  choice can depend on how much the compiler had read before the function, in
  the original source file. tools/headers.py finds a set that happens to
  reproduce that state; when none does, the answer is probably the original
  file's other contents (defining real neighbours in the same file is the
  closest we can get for now).
- **Spelling a constant multiply as shifts that reuse a temporary** (`(q << 31)
  - q`) forces that value to be computed first; useful for diagnosing
  evaluation-order problems, but it changes the instructions, so it is not a
  fix in itself.
- **`_Ubound`/`_Lbound` with the returned iterator built before the lock's
  destructor**: they hold a `std::_Lockit` for the whole body; move the locked
  tree walk into a `static inline` helper and build the iterator from its result
  afterwards.
- **`_Tree::_Dec`/`_Inc` node layout**: the `_Color` field's offset follows the
  value type's size (an 8-byte pair at +0xc puts it at +0x14; a 0x30-byte value
  moves it to +0x3c), and that decides the whole function's match.
- **A run of inlined constructors that suddenly calls one out of line** (or
  inlines a derived constructor but calls its base): MSVC's /Ob2 inlining
  budget ran out. Define every callee's body in the file, including the ones the
  original still calls out of line, so the budget runs out at the same place
  (0x408cb0).
- **A bitfield bit tested as `mov edx, ecx; shr edx, N; test dl, 1` inside an
  `&&` chain**: write `!(unsigned char)bf`; `!bf` and `bf == 0` give
  `test ch, mask` (0x4089a0).
- **`fild` operands from a Vec3 temporary in memory**, with a literal 0 stored
  for one component: the length helper takes `const Vec3&` and is called on a
  temporary, `Length(a - b)` (0x408100).
- **`field = g_game->ticks + FUN_004b6c30(n) + K` folds into `lea eax,
  [eax+edx+K]`**: when the original does `add eax, K; mov edx, [ticks]; add
  edx, eax`, compute the delay into a local first (0x407ae0, 0x407e90).
- **A comparison with an inlined `vector::size()` on the right is evaluated
  right side first**: if the original computes the left side first, put it in
  its own statement (`int d = dx * dx + dz * dz; if (d < limit * (int)v.size())`)
  (0x407560).
- **A real call to 0x4e84e0 is memmove**: /O2 always inlines `memcpy` (as
  `rep movsd` plus a tail), so an out-of-line call to the runtime copy is
  `memmove`, usually `std::char_traits<char>::move` from a string method. The
  library's memcpy and memmove are byte-identical, which is why it was once
  named `memcpy`. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #84 (0x4da3f0).
- **Returned by value through a hidden pointer**: a method whose first stack
  argument is a pointer it fills in and then returns in `eax` returns a class
  by value (`Class f(...) const`), not `void f(Class* out, ...)`. The mangled
  name then has `?AV1@` as its return type. See 0x4c9490.
- **Counting loops that index the string**: `for (i = 0; text[i]; i++)`
  compiles to an indexed `cmp byte ptr [eax+ecx], 0` loop; a pointer walk
  (`while (*p) p++`) gives `inc eax` on the pointer instead. Pick whichever
  the original shows. See 0x4da3f0.
- **The /Ob2 inline budget, read out of C2.EXE** (#5172, 0x410850; this
  replaces the guesses in the entries below): a function's budget is
  max(1000, 2 x its own IL size), capped at 35000. Call sites are taken in
  source order. A callee is inlined when its IL size is at most the budget
  left, or when it is under 41 whatever the budget; only callees of 41 or more
  subtract their size. The calls inside an inlined callee share
  (budget left) / R, where R counts this level's call sites still to come,
  including the current one. So empty `Dummy()` calls cost nothing but raise R
  for every earlier site, which is all the old padding did. Moving a block into
  an inline helper shrinks the caller (its budget floors at 1000) and gives the
  helper's own sites (1000 - helper size) to share: in 0x410850 one helper
  replaced 34 `Dummy()` calls. `uv run tools/c2prio.py <addr> --inline` prints
  every site's depth, R, budget left, callee IL size and decision
  (docs/c2-regalloc.md). Its numbers make the share exact: an inlined callee
  costs its IL size if 41 or more, else nothing; its own sites start from
  (budget left - cost) / R, and each level also loses what is inlined below
  it. The hooks: 0x42491e is the function (ecx; IL size at `[[ecx]+0x64]`),
  0x424eef a call site (callee symbol in ebx, IL size in the low 16 bits of
  `[ebx+0x64]`, name `[ebx+0x18]`; budget `[esp+0x48]`, depth `[esp+0x30]`, R
  `[esp+0x2c]`), and 0x424f95 means the site was inlined.
- **Inline budget and nesting depth**: MSVC 5's inline budget depends on the
  whole function and on how deeply calls nest. Wrapping a `std::vector` member
  in one or two plain structs changes which of several identical vector
  constructors stay inline (0x409160). Inline accessor calls elsewhere in the
  function use up budget too, and decide whether a `resize()`'s erase, insert
  and `_Destroy` are inlined (0x409730). When out-of-line STL calls don't
  match, count the inline expansions before them and in the rest of the
  function. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #56.
- **Float subexpressions in min/max macros**: a windows.h `min`/`max`
  evaluates its arguments more than once. A branch-free float subexpression
  (`(float)(x * -0.02f) + (b ? 25 : 0)`) is computed once and spilled, while a
  term with a branch is recomputed. If the original reuses a spilled float
  inside the macro, write the whole thing as one expression rather than using
  a float local. A `(float)` cast around `x * -c` stops MSVC folding the
  negative constant into a subtraction. See 0x409730.
- **Bit tests through a copied bitfield**: two tests on one flags word that
  use `mov ecx, ebx; shr ecx, N; test cl, 1` come from a local copy of the
  bitfield struct (`Flags f = def->flags; if (f.bit11) ...`); testing the field
  in place gives `test bh, 8`. See 0x409730.
- **Bottom-tested loops behind one guard**: a loop the original tests at the
  bottom, entered through a single `if (n > 0)`, is
  `if (n > 0) { do { ... } while (row < n); }`. When the original also shows a
  duplicated entry `test; je`, put the guarded loop in an inline member helper
  whose body starts with its own `if (bits)` guard. Found by DeepSeek V4.1
  Flash in #11 (0x40d900, 57% to 73%).
- **`__stdcall` STL heap helpers**: a make_heap or pop_heap body that ends in
  `ret N`, called from a function that also inlines `std::vector` code, is
  declared `__stdcall`, with the inline wrapper's body written at the call
  site. How many inline helpers the function uses decides which vector members
  /Ob2 leaves out of line. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #57 (0x40a260).
- **Struct fields copied with `fld`/`fstp`**: a field copied through the FPU
  instead of with `mov` was passed through a `float` parameter of an inline
  constructor. See 0x40a7b0.
- **Emitting a `std::vector` constructor out of line**: a constructor's
  address can't be taken, and no vector member calls
  `vector(const allocator&)`. An explicit instantiation,
  `template class std::vector<T>;`, emits every member out of line, including
  the constructors. See 0x40c510 and the STL section of docs/consolidation.md.
- **Placeholder names on small STL members**: a tiny `size()`
  (`(last - first) >> 2`), `capacity()` or empty-bodied destructor filed as
  `Class_XXXXXXXX::FUN_XXXXXXXX` is usually a `std::vector` member. If your
  bytes match but check.py says a reference is wrong, report the name in your
  pull request instead of renaming it. A function that destroys a whole object
  (0x40b390) names every member's out-of-line destructor by offset, which is
  the quickest way to tie `~vector()` copies to element types. Found by Claude
  Opus 5.5 in #56, #57 and #88.
- **A copied shift in a scratch register is a multiply**: if the original
  computes a shift in one register and copies it (`mov ecx, edx; shl ecx,
  0x13; mov esi, ecx`) where yours shifts straight into the target, write a
  multiply (`origin.x * 0x80000`, not `<< 19`). MSVC turns the multiply into a
  shift after register allocation, so the copy appears. Found by Claude Opus
  5.5 in #82 (0x40f2a0).
- **Sum into a temporary, then copy**: if all three loads come before any
  store, one component sits in a callee-saved register and the stores run x,
  y, z, write `Vec3 sum; sum.x = a.x + b.x; ...; Vec3 dest = sum;`. Writing
  `dest`'s fields directly, `operator+`, or a helper returning by value all
  interleave the loads and stores. See 0x40f2a0.
- **A mask kept in a register**: `mov ebx, 0xe0; test bl, al` (with ebx reused
  by a later `or eax, ebx`) comes from casting the parameter,
  `(unsigned char)flags & 0xe0`; plain `flags & 0xe0` gives `test al, 0xe0`.
  See 0x40f2a0.
- **A dead `operator delete(0)`**: a constructor that zeroes a pointer and
  then deletes it emits a real `delete` of a register that holds 0. If the
  original reloads the pointer instead of pushing a constant, clearing it with
  `memset(&field, 0, 4)` rather than `field = 0` stops MSVC propagating the
  zero. Found by DeepSeek V4.1 Flash in #12 (0x40e9e0).
- **A struct local the original keeps in memory**: if yours lands in
  registers, build it from an inline `operator-` (or `+`) that returns the
  struct by value (`Vec3 d = *to - *from;`). Assigning field by field, an
  `int[3]`, inline methods on `this`, constructors and taking its address all
  ended up in registers. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #90 (0x40beb0).
- **Three `fild`s kept on the x87 stack in x, y, z order**: convert each
  component into its own `double` local before summing the squares; writing
  `(double)x * x + ...` reorders the terms. See 0x40beb0.
- **A value the original computes twice**: write the expression twice (for
  example `g_game->width >> 1`) rather than caching it in a local; MSVC then
  schedules it as the original does. See 0x40d7b0.
- **A bit loop tested twice on entry**: write
  `if (dirty[i]) { unsigned bits = dirty[i]; ... while (bits) ... }`. Loading
  `bits` first and testing `if (bits)` drops the second test. See 0x40d900.
- **A `?:` on a one-bit bitfield choosing between two strings**: write
  `(flag != 0) ? "ON" : "OFF"` to get `test byte ptr [m], mask; mov eax, <on>;
  jne; mov eax, <off>`. `flag ? a : b` gives `shr`/`test`, and `!flag ? b : a`
  flips the branch. Found by DeepSeek V4.1 Flash in #16 (0x418cd0).
- **A label and `goto` instead of an outer loop**: MSVC 5 weights register
  priority by loop nesting, so an extra loop level changes which variable gets
  which register. In 0x40e160 an outer `for (;;)` around two inner loops put
  `this` in ebp; a label with a `goto` back to it (as the original evidently
  did) gave `this` esi and raised the score from 62% to 82%. Found by Claude
  Opus 5.5 in #81.
- **Inlined 16.16 multiplies that compile two ways**:
  `(int)(((__int64)s * f()) >> 16)` gives `imul reg` at some sites and
  `mov ecx, eax; mov eax, reg; imul ecx` at others. A `FixMul(a, b)` helper
  taking both as parameters gives the second form. When the forms differ per
  site, mix the two spellings, then run tools/headers.py. See 0x40e160.
- **A top-tested loop under an `else if`, failure path last**:
  `else if (Size() != 0) { while (1) { if (Size() == 0) break; ... } } else { fail }`.
  A plain `while (Size() != 0)` gets rotated, and
  `else if (Size() == 0) { fail } else { ... }` puts the failure block first.
  See 0x40eb70.
- **A shared cleanup block that jumps back to the main epilogue**: one branch
  falls into a label (`finish:`) that another reaches with `goto`. A `return`
  inside a scope with a destructor gives that exit its own epilogue copy
  instead. See 0x40e630.
- **Toggling a bit in a plain integer field**: `f = (f & ~mask) | (~f & mask)`
  gives the same load, not, and, or sequence as toggling a one-bit bitfield;
  `f ^= mask` compiles to a memory `xor`. Found by DeepSeek V4.1 Flash in #17
  (0x418d90, 0x418e50).
- **A `lea` kept in a register before a field load**: `lea reg, [base+idx*4]`
  followed by a load from `[reg+K]`, instead of one folded address, means the
  field was read twice through a pointer local
  (`if (c->dir != dir) dir = c->dir;`). MSVC merges the second load but keeps
  the address. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #99 (0x40e050).
- **A two-field inequality test that loads y before x**: if
  `a.x != b.x || a.y != b.y` loads the wrong field first, write it as an
  inline `operator!=` on the point struct. See 0x40e050.
- **Inline copies of an out-of-line helper**: give the inline copy the same
  parameters and body as the out-of-line one (for example, have it read
  `node = items[i]` itself rather than being passed the node). Computing an
  argument at the call site changes register allocation before the loop. See
  0x40ef20 against 0x40f060.
- **Match the out-of-line calls before chasing registers**: list the `call`
  lines in each variant's `/Fa` listing and compare them with the original's.
  /Ob2 does not spend its inline budget in source order: in 0x40da70, adding a
  helper call in the second case of a `switch` changed what was inlined in the
  first case above it. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #80.
- **Out-of-line `vector::insert(iterator, size_type, const T&)` copies**
  (0x408f30, 0x40d020, 0x40d290) differ from each other in the original in the
  order of their pointer sums and in register choice, and source, type and flag
  changes don't reach most of those spots. Treat them as compiler state and
  move on quickly. See #56 and #80.
- **Scratch folder names**: cl.exe fails with "cannot execute '.\c2'" if the
  current directory contains a folder named `c1`, `c2` or `c1xx`. Name scratch
  folders something else.
- **Read-modify-write of a few bits in a global byte**
  (`mov al, [m]; and dl, 0xbf; or dl, al`): model the byte as a union of the
  byte and a bitfield struct, and write the field directly. Found by DeepSeek
  V4.1 Flash in #18 (0x4197d0).
- **Set a flag in place before testing another bit**: `t->flags |= K;` with
  no temporary lets MSVC reuse the OR result for a later test of another bit,
  where `int f = t->flags | K; t->flags = f;` reloads it. See 0x41b8d0.
- **The order of a sum of three or more terms can be compiler state**: in one
  scratch file, five identical copies of `p[0] + p[2] + p[4] + p[6]` compiled
  to three different orders. A quick test is to print only the sum's load
  order across all header sets (tools/headers.py); if the pairing you need
  never appears, stop rewriting the source and try defining the real
  neighbouring functions in the same file instead. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in
  #103 (0x4181d0).
- **`<< 8` and `* 256` on a zero-extended byte**: `b << 8` compiles to
  `mov ch, [mem]`, `b * 256` to `mov cl, [mem]; shl ecx, 8`. See 0x4181d0.
- **A pointer kept across a run of calls**: taking `T* p = &g_game->field;`
  before the calls keeps it in a callee-saved register; re-reading
  `g_game->field` at each use makes MSVC reload `g_game`. Found by DeepSeek
  V4.1 Flash in #20 (0x41cc60).
- **A two-value setter inlined in a loop**: an inline `SetPos(x, y)` gives
  MSVC's right-to-left argument evaluation (y first) and its split temporary;
  writing the two stores directly does not. See 0x41d1f0.
- **A local shared across the arms of an `if` swaps registers**: if two
  values (say a unit pointer and a field loaded from it) come out in each
  other's registers, declare a separate local inside each arm instead of one
  before the `if`. Found by DeepSeek V4.1 Flash in #19 (0x41bf10, 46% to
  100%).
- **A point read once into a local and passed to two inline helpers**: if the
  original reads a `Point` once as a dword, keeps it in an argument's stack
  slot and spills one coordinate of the cell result as a short, copy it first
  (`Point origin = def->origin;`) and pass the local to both WorldToCell and
  CellToWorld helpers. Passing `def->origin` to each keeps the cell in
  registers and shrinks the frame by 4. See 0x419670.
- **The two sides of a comparison evaluated in the wrong order**: run
  tools/headers.py before rewriting the expression. The heavier side (here a
  pointer chain ending in a byte) is loaded first, and the other value then
  takes a callee-saved register or the scratch registers come out mirrored;
  the header set decides which. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #113 (0x41bde0,
  0x41c060).
- **Siblings can need different headers**: functions from one original
  source file, each in its own file here, can need different header sets
  (0x41bde0 needs `<stdlib.h>` and fails with `<windows.h>`; 0x41c060 is the
  reverse). Run headers.py for each function rather than copying a sibling's
  includes.
- **Compiler state or the wrong source?** Score a scratch copy with N unused
  `extern int dummyN;` declarations in front, for N from 0 to about 400. If
  any N matches, the source shape is right and only the compiler's state
  differs; a legitimate header set (tools/headers.py, or ordinary pairs such
  as `<stdio.h>` + `<string.h>`) or defining the real neighbouring function
  above it can reach that state. Never commit the dummy declarations. Found by
  Claude Opus 5.5 in #111 (0x417f60 matched for N = 195 to 289). Run it
  first even when earlier notes call a difference structural: in #223 two
  attempts had blamed the source for what one header fixed (0x43def0, 64% to
  94%). The score can repeat with a period (about 525 declarations there);
  sweeping N from 0 to 400 in steps of 4 with parallel `check.py --sym` runs
  takes about 5 seconds.
- **Two weights sharing one local**: with `a - t` and `b - t` on the same local
  `t`, MSVC 5 computes `-t` once with `neg` and adds it. If the original has
  two separate `sub`s, give each weight its own local holding the same value.
  See 0x417f60.
- **A vertex swap that loads x and y together and stores them after the
  height**: the vertex is an `{x, y}` struct passed by value, with the height
  as a separate parameter. See 0x417f60.
- **A constant loaded into a register and pushed**: if every caller does
  `mov eax, K; push eax` instead of `push K`, that parameter is a 4-byte
  struct (or union) passed by value; declaring it `int` always gives
  `push K`. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #98 (FUN_004103a0's scale).
- **A frame one struct bigger than the original's**: the earlier locals were
  probably inside an inline helper. MSVC 5 reuses an inline helper's stack
  slots for later locals, but not a plain `{ }` block's. See 0x412d40.
- **`_hypot`, not `hypot`**: the bytes match either way, but check.py flags
  `hypot` as the wrong reference.
- **Scratch file names that differ only in case** (`h3a.cpp`, `h3A.cpp`) share
  one object file under Wine, and check.py then reports "compile failed" with
  no error.
- **A doubled test and shared failure exit in a do/while loop**: replacing
  `return 0;` inside the loop with `if (cond == 0) continue;` reproduces the
  redundant bottom test MSVC 5 keeps. Found by DeepSeek V4.1 Flash in #21
  (0x41d6a0).
- **A load that comes one slot too late after a store**: MSVC 5 only moves a
  load above a store when both are fields of the same pointer (`c->a`,
  `c->b`), not when they go through two different `int&` or `int*` locals. If
  one load is late and everything else matches, rewrite the per-field
  references as fields of one struct pointer; the `lea`s look the same either
  way. Splitting `((m - c->a) / 4 + c->b) * 16` into a `d = (m - c->a) / 4`
  local can then swap which registers those `lea`s get. Found by Claude Opus
  5.5 in #118 (0x41cd50), where the N-declarations test showed the old source
  was the wrong shape: 82.8% at every N.
- **A narrow parameter pushed as a full dword**: if the callee's own file
  declares a parameter `char` or `short` but your caller pushes a full dword
  load (`mov ecx, [esi+0x36]; push ecx`), declare it `int` in your file; the
  narrow type adds a byte or word load. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #97
  (0x4118e0).
- **`push reg` of a register known to hold 0** can be a literal `0` argument;
  MSVC 5 reuses the register (0x4118e0 `push edi`, 0x411f50 `push ebx`).
- **An argument evaluated before `new`** was a local computed before the
  `new` expression (`Unit* pad = pads[...];`). See 0x4118e0.
- **Unsolved: a constant factor moved last in a float product**: in
  `(float)sqrt(x) * 30.0f * n` MSVC 5 moves the constant last (and may negate
  it to turn a following `+` into a `sub`); parentheses keep the order but turn
  `fidiv`/`fimul` into `fild`-based code. See 0x411f50 if you solve it.
- **A pointer field re-read each iteration with base and index swapped**:
  bind a reference to the field (`NameEntry*& entries = list->entries;`) so
  MSVC reloads it and bases the `lea` on the loop offset. Found by DeepSeek
  V4.1 Flash in #22 (0x421f20).
- **Padding a struct to a power-of-two size** turns element indexing into a
  shift (`shl edx, 8`) and can fix the surrounding registers as a side effect,
  where an explicit multiplication does not. See 0x421da0.
- **`delete p` rather than a spelled-out destructor and `operator delete`**:
  when the two differ only in a callee-saved register, write `delete p`; MSVC
  keeps `p` live across the call and reuses the same zero for the following
  field stores, which also turns a register store into an immediate `0`.
  Found by Space Bunny Free in #27 (0x42f3a0).
- **A loop over a global array of fixed-stride records**: write
  `Record* p = &g.arr[i];` in an `int i` loop to get
  `lea reg, [base+idx*stride+disp]` with a byte-offset induction variable and
  an immediate zero store; a `char*` base plus a manual offset rotates the
  increment and puts the zero in a register. See 0x42e310.
- **Compare byte counts first**: when yours is a few bytes longer or shorter,
  the difference often names the cause (an immediate `0` store is 4 bytes
  longer than a register store). See 0x42f3a0.
- **Advancing a member pointer, one register or two**: `p++` or `*++p` on a
  member gives `mov edx, [esi+N]; inc edx; mov eax, edx; mov [esi+N], edx`;
  `char* q = p; p = q + 1;` gives the one-register
  `mov eax, [esi+N]; inc eax; mov [esi+N], eax`. Both can occur in one
  function, so change only the loop that differs; an inline helper returning
  `++p` gives the two-register form too. Found by Space Bunny Free in #25
  (0x428d10).
- **A local frame bigger than your locals add up to**: the original probably
  had one struct with a padding field (0x4295b0 needed
  `int w; int h; int unused; char header[0x40];` for a 0x4c frame).
- **Arrays before a far global offset**: when a function uses a table at a
  large fixed offset (`+0x33e13`), size the arrays before it so the offset
  comes out right; their sizes are not visible in the function itself. See
  0x429470.
- **A one-bit test of `[m+1]` can be a 16-bit flags word at `m`**:
  `test byte ptr [esi+0xff], 2` is also what `(flags & 0x200)` on an
  `unsigned short` at +0xfe compiles to, and the wider field changes which
  callee-saved registers MSVC hands out. If a register swap survives the
  N-declarations test and every rewrite, try the flag field as a byte, a word
  and a dword. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #146 (0x422040).
- **A tail call after an if/else**: writing the call separately in both
  branches (rather than once after the join) avoids a phi copy
  (`mov eax, [esp+0x24]; mov [esp+8], eax`) and matches the original. Found by
  Space Bunny Free in #34 (0x43e2e0).
- **Out-of-line STL helpers and the inline budget**: every inline expansion
  costs budget whatever its size, the inliner handles outer call sites before
  nested ones and later source before earlier source, so a helper such as
  `vector::_Destroy` is left out of line only when it sits one inline level
  down or big inlined code follows it. Adding N trivial inline calls in a
  scratch copy measures how much budget is missing. Found by Claude Opus 5.5
  in #96 (0x410e70).
- **A value kept in a register across a `switch` where the original reloads
  it in one case**: move the earlier test into an inline helper that re-reads
  the object through its parent (`Unit* t = order->target;` inside it). See
  0x4111b0.
- **Try `<windows.h>` before a long source search**: in #23 and #30 it alone
  fixed several operand-order and register differences that no rewrite had
  (0x422170, 0x423710, 0x437a30).
- **A function a few bytes short because two blocks share an ending**: MSVC 5
  merges identical block endings (one block jumps into the other's last
  instruction) before it schedules instructions. If the original keeps two
  blocks apart that end in the same store, one of them had a different last
  statement in the source, which the scheduler then reordered. Swap
  independent stores in the other block (0x42a140: `flags |= 1; type = 0xd1;`
  rather than the reverse). Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #160.
- **Two stores in the wrong order, and reordering moves a constant into a
  register instead**: the stores may have been an inline helper. One
  `static inline` function holding both stores in their plain order, used for
  every cell, matched 0x4246b0. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #161.
- **A value pushed out of an inlined search counter's register by later
  locals**: write the call once per branch into a result local, which MSVC
  merges, so each branch pushes its own arguments and frees the register. See
  0x423160.
- **What spends the /Ob2 inline budget**: depth-1 call sites are handled in
  source order and deeper ones last-first. Tiny helpers cost nothing, even
  ones with a call, a branch or a `new`; big inlined bodies do, and so does a
  big candidate that /Ob2 rejects. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #131 (0x4152f0).
- **A helper that returns a flag leaves a test behind**: when an inlined
  helper's last `return` falls through to its end, the caller keeps
  `mov eax, K; test eax, eax; je`. If the original has no such test, the code
  was not a helper returning a flag. A helper whose value the caller returns
  directly (`int r = Helper(); return r;`) leaves nothing (#5172).
- **Several `new` branches sharing a tail**: an if/else-if chain that assigns
  one pointer, followed by one shared call, merges the constructor tails the
  way the original does; separate `if (...) { ...; return 3; }` blocks merge
  only some of them.
- **Counter updates after the rates**: writing all the `prev = cur` stores
  after the rate computations keeps each current counter in its own
  callee-saved register, and the scheduler moves the stores back up. See
  0x415fa0.
- **A `__stdcall` function with one more push than its signature**: a
  function that pushes an argument for a method callee of the same call also
  pops it, so count the pushes against the `ret N`. Found by Space Bunny Free
  in #28 (0x431950).
- **One induction variable for `i*A + j*B` in a nested loop**: the original
  does `mov ebp, esi` before the inner loop and `add ebp, B` in it, re-reading
  the list pointer every iteration. Read the pointer into a local inside the
  inner loop body; the direct `g.lists[i].entries[j]` gives a `lea` each time,
  and a local declared outside the loop is never reloaded. Found by Claude
  Opus 5.5 in #176 (0x41ace0).
- **Stack order of char arrays in a big frame** follows their size and use
  count, not their declaration order: a `char[17]` sits below a `char[32]`
  but a `char[20]` above it, so use the exact byte count the code implies. See
  0x41aa00.
- **Every branch ending in `f(obj); return;`**: write one call after an
  if/else-if chain. MSVC copies it into each branch, and the lower use count
  decides which callee-saved register `obj` gets. See 0x41aa00.
- **Base and index of `[a+b+disp]` in a loop can flip with headers alone**: if
  headers.py finds nothing, try declaring the CRT functions you use by hand
  with no includes at all, then the N-declarations test. See 0x41ace0.
- **Similarity scores rose on 27 September**: check.py's diff now shows every
  operand the linker fills in as `<addr>` on both sides (it used to show ours
  as `[0]`, `push 0` or a call to the next instruction, which counted as a
  difference). Partials scored about 7.5 points higher overnight; compare only
  with scores measured since, and expect far shorter diffs.
- **A constant held in a register for the whole function** is not a matter
  of how often it is used: MSVC 5 seems to give constants only the byte
  registers the variables leave free, so the fix is a source change that moves
  the variables, not more uses of the constant. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in
  #195 (0x450240, unsolved).
- **Which variable becomes the index in `p[a + b]`**: when one term is a loop
  counter in a register and the other a local kept on the stack, the one
  declared first becomes the addressing-mode index, whatever the expression
  says. `add edx, base; mov [edx+i]` needs `int i;` declared before
  `int base;`; the N-declarations test stays flat. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in
  #197 (0x44bfd0, 82% to MATCH).
- **A call to 0x401000 is the `vector constructor iterator`** (`??_H`):
  `push ctor; push N; push size; push array` constructs an array of a class
  with a constructor. /Ob2 normally inlines it as a loop and leaves the call
  only when its budget has run out; giving the element types destructors did
  that in 0x460e20. See 0x401000.cpp for how the helper itself is emitted.
  Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #225.
- **A member's vtable store after the stores to later members**: those later
  members were set in the member-initialiser list; MSVC 5 stores a member's
  vtable after the initialisers and before the constructor body. See 0x460e20.
- **An inlined `unsigned char` search result stored to a stack byte on both
  exits** (`mov [esp+N], bl` when found, `mov [esp+N], 0xa` after the loop,
  then `mov eax, [esp+N]; and eax, 0xff`): the caller stored it in an `int`
  (`int i = Find();`). Two separate stores of the "not found" value come from
  two `return 10;` statements. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #228 (0x4526c0).
- **A parameter kept in its stack slot while the loop counter gets a
  callee-saved register**: look for a comparison of that parameter that
  belongs inside an inlined search helper, whose own parameter is a separate
  variable. See 0x4523e0 (51% to MATCH).
- **A scan loop ending `je <exit>; jmp <body>`** (not `jne <body>`), with
  every exit going to far-away blocks, is an inline helper returning 1 or 0
  from inside the loop; the helper may also hold the "nothing to scan" early
  return and debug prints around the loop. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #239
  (0x461b10, 0x461c20).
- **An out-of-line failure `return 0` at the very end** with `xor eax, eax`
  interleaved with the pops, while an earlier `return 0` has its own epilogue:
  MSVC merges any other `return 0` into the final one, so the failing path is
  probably an inline helper tested with `if (!Helper()) return 0;`. See
  0x461750 (86.5% to 98.6%).
- **A template calling another overload of itself**: check.py names a
  function by its mangled name up to the first `@@`, so two overloads of one
  template member (such as `_Tree::erase(iterator)` and
  `erase(iterator, iterator)`) get the same name, and a call from one to the
  other is reported as pointing at the wrong address. If your bytes match and
  that is the only failure, say so in the pull request; the orchestrator adds
  a row to data/aliases.csv (#249, 0x46e890).
- **Specialise `allocator<T>::destroy` to call a `/Gz` `_Destroy` directly**
  when an inline `std::_Destroy(T*)` overload calling the `__stdcall` FUN_
  stays a call one level too deep. See 0x46eaa0.
- **Helpers defined later in the file are still inlined**: MSVC 5 /Ob2
  inlines non-inline functions defined after their caller in the same file.
  Tiny vector members (`size()`, a default constructor) called out of line
  from only one function usually mean such helpers; write them as inline
  class methods and use the real `<vector>`. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #248
  (0x433380, which inlines 0x433500, 0x4335e0 and 0x4335f0).
- **A short parameter sign-extended separately at each use**
  (`mov di, word ptr [param]`, then a `movsx` per use) means one use goes
  through an inlined helper that changes its own short parameter (`n--`);
  otherwise MSVC shares one sign-extended copy. See 0x433380.
- **A narrow compiler-state window**: sweep N from 0 to about 35 in steps of
  1 for each candidate header set and pick the one where N = 0 sits in the
  middle of the matching range, so a later added declaration does not flip it.
- **A stack load after a `push imm` means `__stdcall`**: if the original does
  `push K; mov eax, [esp+X]; push eax; call` and yours hoists the load above
  the push, the enclosing function is `__stdcall`, even with no arguments and
  a plain `ret`; MSVC 5 hoists such loads only in `__cdecl` functions. Found
  by Claude Opus 5.5 in #211 (0x41f0a0).
- **An inlined helper's result tested with `test al, al`** after
  `mov eax, 1` / `xor eax, eax`: store it in a `char` local
  (`char next = Helper(); if (next)`); a `bool` helper gives `mov al, 1`. See
  0x41f0a0.
- **MSVC 5 never unrolls loops**: a body repeated four times at +0..+3 was
  four source statements in a loop indexed `i*4+k`. Found by Claude Opus 5.5
  in #210 (0x41dfc0).
- **Clamps and the `min`/`max` macros**: `cmp eax, -1; jle keep; or eax, -1`
  is windef.h's `min(-1, d)` with the constant first (`min(d, -1)` gives
  `jl`); when the original compares the value first (`cmp v, t; jge keep`),
  write the ternary `v < t ? t : v`, since `max(t, v)` gives `cmp t, v; jle`.
  See 0x41dfc0 and 0x41e270.
- **Reading tools/headers.py**: "FIXED: N header set(s) make this function
  MATCH" means those sets fix it; include one. (It used to say "N header
  set(s) give identical bytes", which two attempts at 0x4399f0 misread as
  "headers change nothing" and missed a one-header fix; #267.) When the
  N-declarations windows repeat, sweep one full period per header set and
  pick the set whose window has N = 0 furthest from both edges.
- **When the N-declarations test stays flat, go bigger before rewriting**:
  0x41ce90 scored the same for 0 to 400 `extern int`s and every headers.py
  set, but matched with 2000 or more unused function prototypes. Big real
  headers after `<windows.h>` reach such states: `<string>`, `<vector>` +
  `<map>` and `<iostream>` each fixed it, while `<vector>`, `<map>`, `<list>`,
  `<ddraw.h>`, `<dsound.h>` and `<dplay.h>` alone did not. Found by Claude
  Opus 5.5 in #209 (0x41ce90, fixed with `<string>`).
- **A pointer loop that loads the end before the begin** needs
  `T* last = p->end;` before the `for`. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #208.
- **A field load MSVC hoists above a store the original keeps first**: write
  the store through a `T&` to the field. See 0x41ba60.
- **check.py hanging with `[CL.EXE] <defunct>` under it**: it started the
  shared wineserver, which holds its output pipe while other agents compile.
  Kill that check.py (the server keeps running) and wrap long scratch runs in
  `timeout`.
- **A register swap between two pointers in one loop can be a single
  weighted use**: adding or removing one use of either is a quick test for a
  priority tie. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #276 (0x424890).
- **An inlined helper's spelling can differ from its standalone file**: the
  inlined copy of FUN_00422e40 in 0x424c00 wants
  `if (i != 0xffff) return i; return f(name);`, while 0x422e40.cpp matches with
  `if (i == 0xffff) i = f(name); return i;`.
- **Finding what spends the inline budget in a big STL function**: delete later
  code in a scratch copy and watch which calls appear in the `/Fa` listing; one
  extra `v->begin()` pushed an `erase` out of line in 0x424c00.
- **A stretch that is a matched neighbour's body instruction for
  instruction**: write it as an inline copy of that neighbour and call it. A
  `sub esp, N` frame the function never seems to need can be that neighbour's
  by-value struct argument. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #333 (0x4861d0, 62.9%
  to MATCH).
- **A `xor reg, reg` before a 16-bit load that the original lacks**, where the
  value goes into an inlined helper: the helper's parameter is
  `unsigned short`, not `int` with a cast, even if the helper's own file
  matches with `int`. See 0x4861d0.
- **A loop pointer that points at a field** (`lea edx, [base+0x1b6f]`, then
  `[edx-0xc]`) where the original's points at the element start: the original
  walked an explicit `p++` pointer instead of indexing `&arr[i]`. Found by
  Claude Opus 5.5 in #295 (0x453c20).
- **Stopping MSVC from reusing loaded values**: spelling the first test through
  `p->field` and later reads through `g_game->players[j].field` stops the
  reuse, which changes which byte registers are free. See 0x456760.
- **`mov al, [m]; and eax, 0xff` widening** only appears when an unsigned char
  value sits in a register before being widened (a byte local used twice, or
  byte locals followed by an `if`); plain loads, casts and bitfields give
  `xor eax, eax; mov al, [m]`. See 0x456de0.
- **An induction variable biased to a middle field** (`add eax, 0xe`, then
  `[eax-8]`, `[eax-4]`, `[eax]`), kept in a stack slot beside the plain
  iterator: the loop body is an inline element method called as
  `it->Method(...)` that passes `&pos` on to further inline helpers. Found by
  Claude Opus 5.5 in #324 (0x475470).
- **The explored-map lookup** (index computed first, data pointer loaded last)
  is a method on a `{data, width, height}` struct at +0x7c; the same inline
  appears at 0x407f74, 0x465b6a and 0x473a7c (see 0x475470).
- **`a*2 - b*2` always becomes `(a - b) << 1`** in MSVC 5, however it is
  written; when the original shifts both terms separately, the second term was
  a shift of a narrowed value: `((unsigned short)(h >> 2) << 1)` (the cast
  also stops `>> 2 << 1` becoming an `and` mask). Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in
  #275 (0x424050).
- **Separate null returns in an inlined lookup** (`xor reg, reg; jmp` blocks)
  while the two success paths share one tail: a helper with early
  `return 0`s that ends on the success return; a trailing `return 0;` would
  merge all the null returns. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #274 (0x4237d0).
- **Feature code near 0x4233a0 to 0x424050** inlines FUN_004232a0 (spot free
  list), FUN_00421eb0 (footprint centre) and FUN_00423bf0 (burnt-out
  replacement); write them as inline copies.
- **Converted Vec3f locals with all `fild`s first**: MSVC 5 issues the x87
  loads of several converted locals ahead of their stores only when each local
  is used once, by one call (or copied to memory); a local feeding two calls
  gives one fild/fmul/fstp per component. Found by Claude Opus 5.5 in #273
  (0x421700, unsolved).
- **A pointer into a g_game table taken only after the loop guard**
  (`add eax, K` after `jle`): a do/while behind an explicit
  `if (*count > 0)` with the pointer assigned inside it. See 0x422ea0.
- **Only some fields of a struct stored twice** (pos.x and pos.y, not pos.z),
  the first store after a call it could not have moved past: build the value
  in a separate struct local and copy it whole (`Vec3 pos = offset;`). Found
  by Claude Opus 5.5 in #428 (0x437de0).
- **`shl eax, 16; mov edi, eax`** where yours shifts in place in another
  register: split it into `int r = ...; int radius = r << 16;`. See 0x437de0.
- **`mov cl, [m]; shr cl, N; test cl, 1` on an `unsigned short` bitfield**
  marks a standalone `if (p->bit)`; the same test inside an `&&` chain,
  returned from an inline helper or stored in a local gives
  `test byte ptr [m], mask`. (An `int` bitfield loads a whole dword.) Found by
  Claude Opus 5.5 in #431 (0x496bb0).
- **`je <tail>; jmp <body>` into another branch's body** means MSVC merged
  two identical copies: write the body out in each branch. See 0x496ce0.
- **A field declared `volatile` in the original**: every write goes through a
  register (`mov cx, [m]; or ecx, 4; mov [m], cx`) and every repeated bit test
  re-reads memory. Only then is `volatile` right; see AGENTS.md and
  0x494e70 (#436).
- **Scoring many variants**: `uv run tools/check.py <addr> <scratch.cpp> --sym <part
  of the mangled name>` checks a scratch file; put many variant functions in one
  file and score each.
- **Smacker video (smackw32.dll, imported by ordinal)**: the imports have no
  names in the exe, so declare them `extern "C" __declspec(dllimport) ...
  __stdcall` with the names below and keep them consistent. Inferred from call
  sites, not from an export table: 14 SmackOpen, 17 SmackSoundOnOff, 18
  SmackClose, 19 SmackDoFrame, 20 SmackSummary, 21 SmackNextFrame, 23
  SmackToBuffer, 27 SmackGoto, 28 SmackToBufferRect, 38
  SmackSoundUseDirectSound. Smack struct: Width +4, Height +8, Frames +0xc,
  FrameNum +0x374, LastRect +0x380..+0x38c (0x47c330).
- **A search returning 0 when nothing is found** with `xor eax, eax` before the
  loop: `int result = 0; for (...) if (...) { result = j; break; } return
  result;` (0x440c10).
- **HAPINET wrappers (0x4c97xx-0x4ca8xx)**: `mov eax, <HRESULT>` before the null
  test is `int result = K; if (dp) result = ...; return result;`; the constant
  only after the `je` is an early return inside the `if`, then `return K;`.
  IDirectPlay2 slots: EnumPlayers +0x30, GetPlayerName +0x54, Receive +0x64,
  Send +0x68.
- **DirectPlayCreate** is DPLAYX ordinal 1 (thunk at 0x4faffc); call it from
  the toolchain's `<dplay.h>`. The GUID at 0x4fcd78 is IID_IDirectPlay3A, which
  the DirectX 3 header lacks: declare `extern GUID DAT_004fcd78;` (0x4ca900).
- **COM calls by slot**: work out the DirectX interface from the vtable slot
  and call the real method (IDirectSoundBuffer: +0x24 GetStatus, +0x48 Stop).
- **Header sets are not monotonic**: one header can flip an operand order that
  a larger set does not; try several combinations in scratch with `/Fa`.
- **A `new` of a class with two bases**: the second base's vtable store survives
  in the listing while the first base's disappears; declare both bases as real
  classes (the second with a pure virtual).
- **Static vs external global objects**: if the atexit destructor of a global
  `std::vector` keeps `_First` in a callee-saved register on the empty path, the
  vector is a file-scope `static` (see `0x434a30.cpp`); the checker accepts the
  compiler's `$S`-suffixed name.
- **Two pointers walking one struct array**, one at +0 and one into the middle
  of a group of fields: the group was accessed through an inlined helper taking
  the sub-struct by reference.
- **Three zeroed registers stored through `lea reg, [this+K]`**: a body assignment
  of a temporary, `v = Vec3(0, 0, 0);`, not a member initialiser.
- **Packing blocks**: keep a struct with a dword at an odd offset (e.g. +0x38a47)
  in its own `pack(1)` block; `pack(2)` silently moves the field.
- **Base and index swapped in an address** (`[esi+eax]` vs `[eax+esi]`, a different
  SIB byte): the same header dependence as commutative operands; adding a
  header fixed it. The `/Fa` listing prints both the same way, so compare
  encodings with `objdump -d -M intel file.obj` (installed).
  `uv run tools/headers.py <addr>` (each line it prints is one complete header
  set) compiles your file with every combination
  of `<windows.h>`, `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<string.h>`, `<math.h>`,
  `<memory.h>` and `<ddraw.h>` in a few seconds and prints the sets that match; try it as soon
  as every rewrite gives the same wrong register or operand order (0x471f90
  needed exactly `<windows.h>` plus `<math.h>`).
- **"-2 jumps away, -1 skips, default stores"**: a `switch` with `case -2`,
  `case -1` and `default`, not an if/else chain.
- **A field tested in one register, then re-read before a COM call** (or copied
  with `mov eax, ecx` when inlined): the call went through an inline method of
  an embedded struct (`d->screen.UnlockSurface()`). The screen lock/unlock pair
  is FUN_004c5e70/FUN_004c5fa0 (`IDirectDrawSurface::Lock` +0x64 and `Unlock`
  +0x80 on the surface at display+0x8c), used by many functions around
  0x4c6b70-0x4c6dc0; see `src/unsorted/0x4c6d20.cpp`.
- **STL templates ending in `ret N`**: that original file was compiled with
  `__stdcall` as the default. Write the template body as an explicit
  `__stdcall` free function (the real `std::` template gives a plain `ret`).
- **Inlined GlobalAlloc pool allocators**: carve n-byte pieces generically
  (`for (rem = 0x2000; rem >= n; rem -= n)`, as in 0x4e2b60), not a fixed count.
- **`mov eax, fs:[0x2c]`** then an indexed load: thread-local storage. Declare the
  variable `__declspec(thread)` (the exe has a `.tls` section).
- **`mul` by a large odd constant, then a shift of `edx`** (`mov eax, 0x10624dd3;
  mul ...; shr edx, 6`): plain unsigned division by a constant (`v / 1000u`).
  The high half of a `mul` by a variable (`mul reg` then using `edx`) is
  `(unsigned int)(((unsigned __int64)a * b) >> 32)`.
- **`cmp eax, ecx; sbb eax, eax` after an inlined `strlen`** (with `ecx` zero):
  write the test as `0 < strlen(s)`; `strlen(s) > 0` or `!= 0` give `neg; sbb`.
- **`lea esi, [base+K]` then `[esi]` accesses, with the base register reused as a
  loop pointer**: the source took a pointer to the field plus a separate array
  pointer and never used the object pointer directly afterwards.
- **An index loop over a global array that should stay indexed**: address the
  array as a member of an enclosing global struct (`g.arr[i]`); the checker
  accepts the struct symbol plus a displacement.
- **Diff against siblings before writing**: compare your function's `ctx.py`
  disassembly with already-matched neighbours (ignoring addresses); several
  functions are byte-identical copies apart from jump targets or `ret N`.
- **A global object with a constructor and destructor**: write
  `Class_x DAT_y;` and annotate the compiler-generated initialiser and atexit
  destructor (`// FUNCTION: 0x49e610 _$E4` / `_$E2`); see `0x49e610.cpp`.
- **An unreferenced `??_E` function** (vector deleting destructor) is emitted by
  `new T[n]` on a class with a destructor; `new T[1]` in the file makes the
  compiler emit it (annotate it with its mangled name).
- **16-bit compares** (`cmp word ptr [m], reg`) against an `int` parameter: cast
  the parameter to the field's type (`field == (unsigned short)p`), or MSVC
  widens with `movzx` and compares 32 bits.
- **Indexing by a global counter**: index with the global itself
  (`arr[g_count]`); keep a local copy only for later comparisons.
- **`mov eax, 0xffff; cmp ax, 0xffff`**: an `unsigned short` helper returning
  0xffff (not `-1`).
- **Parameter width from a byte use**: `mov al, byte ptr [esp+N]` feeding an
  inlined `memset` fill value means an `int` parameter (`unsigned char` adds
  `and eax, 0xff`, `char` gives `movsx`).
- **An erase loop that reads `_First` once, before the loop**: take the iterator
  into a local before the loop (`v.begin()` in the condition reloads it).
- **A call to a small `size()` body from inside a vector's own code**: MSVC 5
  expands `vector::size()` at some sites and calls the out-of-line COMDAT at
  others, even within one function, so a call to a 19 to 35-byte `(_Last -
  _First) / sizeof(T)` body is that vector's `size() const`, not a helper to
  match with a hand-written struct. If your object emits the COMDAT under
  `?size@?$vector@...` and it matches, that is the name (0x470560, 0x471160).
- **Under `/Gz` every `<xutility>` and `<vector>` template is called
  `__stdcall`**: a stray `add esp, N` after a template call means the real
  `__cdecl` header is in scope. Use the `_XUTILITY_` plus `__stdcall` stand-in
  from `0x424c00.cpp` (0x470560 needed it for `std::copy`).
- **Vector copies spend the inline budget; plain field copies do not**: when a
  copy constructor or `operator=` inlines the first few vector copies but calls
  `_Ucopy` for a later one, wrap the tail vectors in a sub-struct with its own
  copy constructor. Scratch builds with two to eight vector members, read from
  the `/Fa` listing, measure the budget without spending `check.py` runs
  (0x470390).
- **A vector with some members inlined and some out of line**: a hand-written
  `namespace std { template ... }` vector reproduces it and keeps the
  protected-access mangling of the exe (0x470c10, 0x433130).
- **`??_U` against `??2`**: `new T[n]` and `operator new(size)` differ in the
  object's symbol, so try the other form when an allocation will not check
  clean. In `_Allocate`, `test eax, eax; jge; xor eax, eax` is
  `if (_N < 0) _N = 0;`, not a null check (0x470c10).
- **Dividing a pointer difference by the element size again**: typed pointer
  subtraction already divides by `sizeof(T)`, so `(last - first) / 52` on
  52-byte elements divides twice. When the original divides once, subtract the
  pointers as `char*` (0x4737c0, 0x475770).
- **An `if/else` storing one of two constants is not `x = (cond);`**: both emit
  `test; setne; mov`, but the expression form adds a 32-bit temporary and a
  hoisted `xor`, which can push a loop past the short-jump limit (0x457540).
- **A driver table of `__stdcall` function pointers** taking the object first
  compiles to `mov ecx, [edx]; push edx; call [eax+N]`, which looks like a
  virtual call. Declare the table as an array of `__stdcall` pointers
  (0x4c6890).
- **Allocate and initialise in one `static inline` helper**: keeping the size
  arguments live across the allocator call puts them in callee-saved registers
  (0x4c6f80, 52% to 100%).
- **A loop counter declared inside an `if` with a `do/while`** puts its `xor`
  after the loop guard; a plain `for` hoists it and reverses the add's operand
  order. Change both together (0x470c10).
- **A code address stored into a field is not always a vtable**: if the value
  is a plain function rather than an address in a `.rdata` vtable, declare the
  field as a function pointer and assign it. `ctx.py`'s `vtable?` mark is only
  a hint (0x460160).
- **Two local arrays 4 bytes apart can move the score by 2%** with the same
  byte count: before keeping a higher-scoring variant, compare the frame
  offsets of the big locals in the `.o` with the original's (0x458fa0).
- **A load that moves across a branch can be an inverted comparison**: the
  wrong direction can still give the right `cmp` and byte count. Check the
  branch polarity before blaming register allocation (0x45ffb0).
- **Frame slot order that differs from declaration order**: a local declared
  without an initialiser and zeroed by a later statement gets its store after
  the initialised locals, which also changes which locals get callee-saved
  registers (0x4b6880, 37.8% to 86.0%).
- **`cmp reg, reg` against a zero register instead of `test reg, reg`**
  appears when a call's result is assigned to a named variable before the
  comparison. Store every call result in a variable of the API's return type
  if the original compares that way throughout (0x4b6880).
- **A reload of an address-taken local that drifts by a couple of
  instructions** around a call's argument pushes, with the displacement
  shifting by exactly 4 per push, is a scheduler tie-break. Don't spend the
  budget on it (0x4b6570, about 30 shapes tried).
- **Rule out the compiler build and the STL revision cheaply**: build once with
  `BT_TOOLCHAIN=msvc5-rtm` (the unpatched compiler, see `tools/wcl`), and `cmp`
  the INCLUDE headers. If putting the exe's real neighbouring instantiations in
  the same file leaves check.py's output byte-identical, the source form is not
  the lever (0x4732e0).
- **A `g_game` field at an odd offset**: test it as
  `*(unsigned char*)((char*)g_game + K) & mask` rather than declaring a field
  that MSVC 5 would align (0x46a610).
- **A flat declaration sweep is a result**: if 0 to 700 unused declarations
  never change the score, the difference is the source shape, so keep
  rewriting; if the score moves, it is compiler state (0x4624a0, 0x46e640).
- **A 1-bit bitfield can free a register**: `p->flags |= 1` on an
  `unsigned char` field is load, `or bl, 1`, store, which occupies `bl`; as an
  `unsigned short started : 1` bitfield it becomes `or byte ptr [ecx+N], 1`
  and the allocation of the rest of the function can change (0x496ee0). When
  diffs in several distant blocks appear together, look for one shared cause
  like this before tuning each block.
- **An out-of-line `_Ufill` call from a `vector(n, value)` constructor**: MSVC
  5 always inlines `_Ufill` there with the real `<vector>`, so declare the
  container by hand with `std::allocator` from `<memory>` and `_Ufill` declared
  only (0x406c40, 0x46ca60, 0x488310).
- **A ternary's operand order picks the branch**: `(w >= 200 ? w : 200)` gives
  `jge` with the value on the fall-through; `(w < 200 ? 200 : w)` does not.
- **Jump table case bodies come out in source order**: when the bodies sit in
  an unexpected physical order, write the case labels in that order rather
  than sorted.
- **Look for twins before starting**: compare the issue's functions with jump
  and call displacements masked. Identical or near-identical pairs are common
  (0x4be950 and 0x4bed70 are one function at two addresses; 0x4bec70 is 91%
  like them), and copying the matched twin's file finishes the other in one
  run.
- **Compute a value in each branch rather than once after the merge** when
  the original repeats it: a single shared local let MSVC fold a later null
  test away (0x4bf4d0).
- **Copies into dead argument slots follow declaration order**: with
  `int y1 = y, x1 = x, y0 = y, x0 = x;` the later copies coalesce into the dead
  `x` and `y` argument slots as self-stores, and the order of the group
  decides which copy lands where (0x4bee60, all 24 orders tried).
- **MSVC 5 does not fold a test of a local's address**: `if (&local == 0)`
  emits a dead `lea; test; jne` and one unreachable arm, which is how
  0x4bee60 reproduces its original.
- **`tools/headers.py --cpp`** also tries `<string>`, `<vector>`, `<map>`,
  `<list>` and `<iostream>`, one at a time on top of every C set (768 builds,
  under a minute). Plain headers.py tries only the seven C headers.
- **`fcomp; fnstsw ax; test ah, 0x40`** is MSVC's `x != 0.0f` (or `== 0.0f`):
  it reads only C3, so a NaN compares equal to 0. That is the compiler's
  normal float test, not a bug to report.
- **Several failure exits sharing one `return 0` epilogue**: MSVC 5 never
  merges two identical `return 0`s, so write one and `goto fail` to it, with
  the locals declared uninitialised at function scope so no jump skips an
  initialiser (0x461db0).
- **`if (p) { ... } else { p = 0; }` after `operator new`** gives the
  original's redundant `xor eax, eax` in the else path and the `jmp` over it;
  `if (!p) return 0;` does not (0x461db0).
- **A countdown over a separate walking pointer** (`k = n - 1; q = p;
  while (k >= 0) { ...; q++; k--; }`) gives `lea edx, [n-1]; cmp; jl` in the
  pre-header and a pointer biased one field high; making the pointer the loop
  variable loses all three (0x461db0).
- **Uninitialised locals get callee-saved registers in declaration order**,
  not assignment order: swapping two declarations swaps their registers
  (0x464700).
- **A reference to a struct member keeps a two-step load**:
  `Unit*& unit = g_game->units[i].unit;` gives `lea ecx, [edx+ecx*8];
  mov ecx, [ecx]` where a plain pointer local folds it into one (0x47dfc0).
- **Compare a small field inline instead of naming a local**:
  `(int)cell->low < minHeight` in place of an `unsigned char low` local removed
  three spill and reload pairs (0x47dfc0, 33.5% to 71.5%).
- **Put pointer advances in the `for` header**
  (`for (col = 0; col < w; col++, cell++)`); as body statements they are
  scheduled differently (0x47dfc0).
- **A score can rise by losing code**: `0xfffe >> 8` is `0xff`, so a mask
  meant as `0xfe` became a no-op that MSVC deleted, and the score went up
  while three instructions went missing. Check the byte count as well as the
  percentage (0x4644d0).
- **A group of `unsigned short` bitfields spans whole bytes**: six bits from
  +0x9b take two bytes, so the struct ends at 0x9d. Check `sizeof` against the
  `memset` count in the disassembly (0x4644d0).
- **A `switch` with a `default:` can become a compare chain** where the
  original has a jump table: spell out every case (0x464060). A guard on the
  outer condition (`if (mask == 0) { switch ... } else ...`) puts the shared
  block after the dispatch.
- **A macro can match where a `static inline` helper does not**: two
  textually separate copies keep their own branch order and register choice,
  where an inlined helper made both copies alike (0x46a610, about 30%). In the
  same function, two identical calls that share one tail in the original were
  written out twice in the source; one shared helper kept them apart.
- **Index an array rather than walk a second pointer when load order
  matters**: `cell`, `cell[1]`, `cell[width]`, `cell[width+1]` loads in source
  order; the same sum through a `next` pointer groups the loads by pointer
  (0x46a610).
- **Handing a function on**: if several remaining differences look like one
  cause, say so and say what class of change to try next. That kind of note
  got 0x488310 matched on the next attempt; a long list of what failed did
  not help 0x48ab70.
- **A function known only through its callees' class**: declare its class as
  deriving from that class (`class Class_00435110 : public Class_00435c00`)
  instead of copying the fields into a new one, so the inherited calls keep
  their established names (0x435110).
- **`vector::insert(iterator, size_type, const T&)` register family**: which
  registers the function uses (`this` in ebp or ebx, and the one-byte `lea`
  base/index swap) follows the numbering order of the third inlined
  `_Ucopy`'s destination and source, not headers or dummy declarations. Write
  that copy as a loop with the destination declared first,
  `{ iterator _d = _Q + _M; const_iterator _s = _P; for (; _s != _Last; ++_d,
  ++_s) allocator.construct(_d, *_s); }`, in the hand-written vector (a helper
  `_Ucopy(dest, src, end)` with the destination parameter first does the same,
  since arguments bind right to left). This took 0x425480 from 57.9% to 80.5%
  and 0x4732e0 to 80.5% in scratch (Sonnet 5.5, #679). 0x425210, 0x46e640 and
  0x44ec30 are still one byte out at 99.6%; dead locals never change it.
  About 1500 variants on 0x44ec30 (every `_Ucopy` form at all four sites, all
  120 tail orders, file layout, and flags from `/Ob1` to `/G6`) never moved
  that last byte, so it most likely comes from compiler state set by the rest
  of the original file, not this function's source. Don't spend a normal budget
  on it (Sonnet 5.5, #759).
- **One write and one read of a stack slot on different paths is a bug
  report, not a matching problem**: list each slot's writes and reads in the
  disassembly (a `grep` is enough) before writing source; such a finding
  survives even if the function never matches (0x4aa8f0, 0x49be60). Convert
  each `[esp+N]` to a frame offset first (see "Convert `esp` offsets" below):
  pending pushes caused most of the false reports so far.
- **More levers, measured**: `docs/field-notes.md` (CubeB, 47 functions in one
  session) ranks the levers that paid, with the numbers: read the toolchain's
  own headers before inferring (`XTREE`, `DSOUND.H`), treat a "register
  allocation" difference as a wrong argument or type first, and grep the exe
  for raw instruction bytes to find matched twins.
- **The target exe is the GOG build, with at least one hand patch**: at
  0x4cda44 a `jmp` into zero padding (0x4fb92a) replaced a `cmp`/`jne` to force
  the CD-music track count. `data/exe_patches.csv` records the compiler's
  original bytes and check.py compares against those. If a function differs
  only where the exe jumps into padding or has a run of `nop`s no compiler
  would emit, report the address and bytes rather than chasing it (0x4cda00).
- **0x4e67f0 is the CRT's `_CIacos`**: a call to it is a plain `acos()`
  (`<math.h>`), not a `__fastcall double` helper (0x49a890).
- **A test of bits 10 and 22 of a dword** (`shr eax, 0xa; test al, 1`) comes
  from a bitfield struct over the dword, not from shifting by hand (0x499eb0).
- **`xor reg, reg; mov reg16, [mem]` before a call** means the callee takes an
  `unsigned int` loaded from a 16-bit field; declaring the parameter
  `unsigned short` loses the zero-extend (0x499eb0).
- **A scripted variant search is cheap**: scoring hundreds of generated
  statement and operand orders with `check.py <addr> <scratch> --sym` costs no
  runs, and found 0x49a890's and 0x49abb0's best forms (Sonnet 5.5, #1082).
- **Store order around a call can depend on how `this` is reached**: with a
  plain local `Display* d = FUN_004b6220();` MSVC puts a struct store before a
  field load; writing the body as an inline method called on the call's result
  (`return FUN_004b6220()->LockMe(out);`) lets the store slide between the
  argument pushes as in the original (0x4c5e70, 0x4c5ff0).
- **A one-expression inline method of an embedded struct** keeps a null test
  and the reload after it separate, where a local or a multi-statement helper
  merges them (`mov eax; cmp eax, edi`) (0x4c5e70).
- **`test eax, eax` where an inline wrapper gave `cmp eax, edi`**:
  `switch (x.Lock(&d)) { case 0: break; default: return 0; }` restores the
  `test` (0x4c5e70).
- **Two adjacent stores in an inline helper** (`Clear()` doing `active = 0;
  type = 0;`) can be what reorders them to match (0x4644d0).
- **A `default:` arm can be read from the jump table**: values that land on
  the same target as named cases, and the `ja` target, show what `default`
  does (0x464060).
- **Search statement orders by script**: a small `uv run` script that calls
  `compile_source` and `compare` from tools/check.py can score hundreds of
  moved-statement variants in parallel at no cost in check runs; a
  move-each-statement hill climb took 0x4644d0 from 94.5% to 99.2% (Sonnet 5.5).
- **Try the calling convention before more shape variants**, even for a
  function with no arguments: the convention still changes what MSVC 5 emits.
  A no-argument free function whose loop reloads a local into a register
  (`mov ecx, [esp+0x10]; cmp ecx, ebx`) where the original compares memory
  directly (`cmp [esp+0x10], ebx`) matched once declared `__fastcall`
  (0x46c920, 0x46ca60; about 400 shape variants had not moved it), and
  0x4c2870 likewise. The default is `__stdcall` (`/Gz`, see "Reading the
  calling convention"), so try `__cdecl` and `__fastcall` on the function and
  its argument-less callees in the same file: 0x4e1730 and 0x4c63a0 need
  `__cdecl` although they take no arguments.
- **Keep a callee's real name with the real container**: when a hand-written
  tree or vector gives a call the wrong name, use the real `std::map` or
  `std::vector` member as a neighbouring matched file does (0x46d1a0).
- **An apparent rematerialisation can be a register role, not a construct**:
  MSVC 5 will not fold a memory operand whose base register is the destination
  of the same instruction, so when the accumulator lives in the same register as
  the base, the load is forced to materialise. A named local can only be
  spilled, never rematerialised, so an original that re-reads a value after a
  test is evidence that the value had **no** local at that point. The
  visibility-gated `Draw` family (0x473590, 0x474170, 0x473a00, 0x4745e0,
  0x474b80) took about 20 attempts, each looking for a source construct, before
  this was understood. When a "missing local" or a re-read will not reproduce in
  a scratch copy, suspect the register roles and stop rewriting the expression.
- **Integer arithmetic shape is not a register lever**: MSVC 5 canonicalises
  every parenthesisation of `a + b - c` identically, so re-spelling an integer
  arithmetic expression never moves the registers it allocates. What does move
  them is the size of the surrounding code, so when a diff shifts after an
  unrelated edit, look at the block that grew or shrank rather than at the
  expression.
- **Naming an inline accessor is an allocation lever, and it cuts both ways**:
  routing expressions through `__inline begin()` / `end()` accessors changes how
  MSVC allocates argument temporaries, and was worth 12 to 25 points on two
  unrelated functions (on 0x470040 it fixed four diffs across two blocks at
  once; on 0x46d6c0 it was worth 12.7 points). The right answer differs per
  site: on 0x46d6c0 the loop had to use the accessors directly while each insert
  needed its own reference in its own nested block. Use an accessor where
  call-level indirection is needed and a plain reference where it is not, and
  expect to try both at each site.
- **A constructor materialises a constant where a field assignment cannot**:
  a literal `0` written into a field always compiles to `mov dword [m], 0`, but
  passing it to a real constructor (`p.first->value = Value_0046d2e0(a, 0, wh,
  flag);`) gives `xor eax, eax; mov [edx+4], eax`, which is what the original
  does. Give the aggregate a constructor rather than assigning the constant to a
  field; verified in three separate shapes on 0x46d2e0.
- **Two values tied for a register can be separated by one more use**: when
  the original gives a handle ebx and a path ebp and yours swaps them, a
  trivial inline wrapper around a call that takes the handle
  (`static inline int Next(int h, ...) { int r = FUN_004bc640(h, ...); return r; }`)
  adds a use without adding bytes and flips the tie (0x4bcb50). Dummy uses
  such as `h = h` are folded away first and do nothing.
- **Byte-wide `xor cl, cl` and `not cl`** come from an `unsigned char` local
  set to 0 on one path and `~v` on the other; a ternary or a cast keeps the
  arithmetic 32-bit (0x4bd160).
- **`cmp; ja exit; jmp top` at the bottom of a loop, with the exit jumping
  past a block that has its own epilogue, is a guard plus a `do` loop whose
  hit arm returns**: `if (u <= end) { do { if (hit) { ...; return; } u++; }
  while (u <= end); }`. A `for` or `while` gives a `jbe top` back edge
  instead, so "a return inside the loop" fails in every `for` spelling
  (0x48d790).
- **A partial can compute the wrong thing, not just the right thing in the
  wrong bytes.** Before building on a previous attempt, check that each store
  in it happens on the same paths as in the original: a stray unconditional
  store after an if/else set a flag on the wrong unit, and removing it was
  part of the fix (0x48d790).
- **MSVC 5 sinks a store only when it is a top-level statement.** Nested in
  an expression (for example, inside an inline helper whose return value is
  assigned), the same store is emitted where it stands. So a store in the
  wrong slot is usually a statement-shape problem, not a scheduling one. The
  nested form can cost a register elsewhere, so check both together
  (0x4ba000, 98.7%). A compiler rule seen in one block is a guess until a
  second block of the same function agrees.
- **A by-value struct argument can decide the register allocation.** MSVC
  may turn it into a live pointer held in a callee-saved register, which
  evicts whatever the original kept there. Passing the value from an inline
  helper that returns the struct by value (`return u->pos;`) gave the
  original's `lea edx, [ebx+0x6a]` and kept ebx for the unit (0x49abb0).
  Before changing an aggregate's type, check which of its fields the
  original actually stores.
- **An `#include` can decide operand order.** At 0x482830 adding
  `#include <string.h>` flipped which operand of a commutative subtraction
  MSVC 5 scheduled first, taking the function from 87.3% to MATCH, while
  `windows.h`, `stdio.h` and `math.h` changed nothing. When operand order
  survives every rewrite of the expression, change something earlier in the
  file (compare declaring `memcpy` by hand at 0x4bf4d0).
- **A helper returning a struct by value, called inside a loop, costs frame
  space.** At 0x418310 `static inline Point Screen(...)` called four times in
  the inner loop was exactly the eight extra frame dwords; writing it out took
  the frame and the byte count to the original's (36.8% to 55.5%). When the
  frame is too big, look for such helpers before working on registers.
- **Stack slots follow declaration order.** MSVC 5 hands out frame slots like a
  plain stack allocator: each newly declared local takes the next slot below
  the last one allocated. So you can plan the declaration order that puts every
  local at the original's `[esp+N]` from a `/Fa` listing, without spending
  `check.py` runs. Dropping a local (by reusing another's value) frees its slot
  for a later one (0x4c0c70, 0x4c1000).
- **To break a common subexpression, re-express one of its uses.** When two
  uses of the same address are shared and no renaming or extra local helps,
  write one of them through a different path (for example
  `defs[DAT_005129b4[i].unitType].name`, reloading the field, instead of
  `defs[type].name`). They are then no longer the same value, and MSVC
  recomputes the address instead of sharing it (0x44c0d0, 77.0% to MATCH).
- **A store that MSVC deletes can still move registers.** At 0x461b10,
  `unsigned int ix = head; head = ix;` compiles to nothing, yet it changed the
  live ranges enough to put two values in the original's registers (86.0% to
  99.0% at the exact byte count, #1844); `#include <memory.h>` then fixed the
  last swapped pair of reloads (MATCH, #2131), and the store is still in the
  matched file. A literal `h = h` is dropped too early to matter (0x4bcb50);
  an assignment from a local holding the same value was not.
- **A swapped pair of reloads, with everything else exact, is often header
  state.** Three functions matched by adding one include and changing nothing
  else: `<memory.h>` at 0x461b10 (the reloads at 0x461bcf/0x461bd3),
  `<string.h>` at 0x4c7a20, and `<windows.h>` at 0x4bc370 (a SIB base
  choice). On a small function whose only diff is such an ordering, run
  tools/headers.py in the first two runs (#2131); if it has already swept every
  set without a win, go back to source shapes (0x4ac4c0, 0x4ac8c0, #2139).
- **A dead reload in the original is register work, not a deleted
  statement.** At 0x453360 two unused `mov eax, [esp+0x14]` reloads are 8 of
  the 9 differing bytes, and their only effect is to occupy `eax` so that
  `g_game` goes to `ecx`. /O2 removes every dead expression (eight
  dead-statement spellings compiled to the same 371 bytes), so the reload is a
  split of the incoming parameter's live range, and adding dead code will not
  reproduce it (#2051, #2079, #2588; still unsolved).
- **Choose which arm falls through.** A value stored just before a branch is
  reused (`mov eax, ecx`) in the arm MSVC lays out as the fall-through and
  reloaded in the other. Flipping 0x43b7c0's case 9 so that the arm using the
  stored `flags | 0x800000` falls through was worth 3.1 points (#2049), and
  inverting 0x44a680's DAT_00512994 guard so the full path falls through fixed
  13 points and the size in one edit (#2457). When a branch's shape is right
  but its edges are not, `if (cond) goto after;` jumps can set the polarity
  where if/else nesting cannot (0x452cc0, exact 848 bytes, #2237).
- **Sharing one block between two switch arms**: set the per-arm value in a
  local before the jump and `goto` the arm that already holds the body
  (`case 3: waitn = 0xf; goto do_wait;`). At 0x43b7c0 that gave the original's
  single Wait block, 59.7% to 71.0% (#2080, #2489). Two textually identical
  inlined copies do not reliably merge, because MSVC can allocate them
  differently. For a plain two-arm `if` whose long arm ends in a call, the
  negated test with the short arm first, `if (!(cond)) { short } else { long }`,
  lets MSVC merge the shared tail (0x4d0f60, 89.1% to 98.4%); inside a switch
  the same shape duplicated the block instead.
- **SIB base or index: split the read from the writes.** To put a pointer in
  the base slot of a load, subscript the memory read with the full index
  expression (`toupper(pat[stack[i]])`) and keep a separate local
  (`int idx = stack[i];`) for the stores. At 0x4bc370 this ended seven passes
  that had called the choice an allocator tie. It needed `#include
  <windows.h>` as well; without it the same source gives the other SIB byte
  (MATCH, #2118).
- **`or reg, reg` with the mask in a register means the mask is a
  variable.** MSVC 5 folds a constant mask to an immediate (one use) or reloads
  it with a fresh `mov` (several uses); it never reads a constant back from a
  copy made before the loop. So `or eax, edx` followed by
  `or word ptr [edi+N], dx` holds a value computed at run time, and no local
  initialised to a constant reproduces it (0x48d790, #2137).
- **Repeat a test to move a load onto another edge.** When 40 or more operand,
  cast and header variants all give the same mirrored register pair, the
  operands are not the lever. At 0x4ddf00, assigning the first operand to a
  `char*` local inside the `if` body and repeating `if (numDebugDirs)` before
  the use put the image base in `eax` and the RVA in `ecx`, as in the original
  (MATCH, #2149).
- **The original can repeat a test that MSVC merges in yours.** Adjacent
  identical guards survive in the original because they were written
  differently (0x464f80's duplicated player checks, 0x458810's doubled
  `test eax, eax`). Make the copies textually different: two spellings of the
  same conjunct took 0x458810 from 81.9% to 87.6% (#2233), and routing one
  copy through a single-use inline helper restored 0x464f80's loop head guard
  (#2479). If yours is 16 or more bytes short with the structure right, look
  for such a pair (#2157).
- **A failure `return` that must be the last block**: wrap the region that can
  fail in `do { ... } while (0);`, ending before the next call, and return
  after it. MSVC 5 then emits the failure path last, with the register pops
  before `xor eax, eax; ret`. This matched 0x461750 (#2248) and its sibling
  0x461020; the inline-helper form in the earlier 0x461750 bullet stopped at
  98.6%.
- **A shared zero register belongs to a variable that later changes.** When
  the original has one `xor esi, esi` at the top and pushes `esi` for dozens of
  zero arguments, the register is a counter that starts at 0 and is changed
  later (0x42bf40: the `sound` loop counter serves about 85 zero arguments). A
  new `int zero = 0;` is constant-folded to `push 0` and never gets a register
  (#2275). For a long-lived zero in `ebx`, what matters is which values are
  live across a call: a stack address live across a call makes MSVC keep the
  zero in `ebx` (the matched 0x435a20), which 0x4624a0 cannot use because only
  four of its values span a call (#2503).
- **Consume a global right after loading it.** At 0x4843c0,
  `int y0 = g_game->scrollY; int ry = y0 % 32; int x0 = g_game->scrollX;
  int rx = x0 % 32;` (each read immediately before its modulo) let MSVC share
  one register between the `g_game` temporary and `x0`, giving the original's
  `mov edi, [g_game]`; loading both globals first left a separate temporary
  (MATCH, #2276).
- **The loop form decides where the increments are scheduled.** A `for`
  loop's increments can land before the body's merged store; at 0x466c20
  `while (j < g_game->width) { ...; j++; mapX += halfWidth; src++; dst++; }`,
  with the increments as tail statements, reproduced the original's loop
  bottom (404 to 402 bytes, MATCH, #2278). When a `continue` must still reach
  the increments, put them in a `do/while` controlling expression behind an
  `if` guard, `do { ... } while (j++, j1++, (short)j < (short)num);`; a `for`
  header adds a second guard test (0x481d50, 53.5% to 79.4%, #2485).
- **Give a sub-expression a fresh value number to change its operand order.**
  MSVC 5 value-numbers each expression instance, so the same value written
  another way is a different value. At 0x4d0f60 the last three differences were
  operand order only, flat across all 128 header sets; `int k = n0 + 1;`, a
  hoisted `int f = flags & 0xff;` tested as `!(f & (1 << j))`, and a recomputed
  `(state.pos + 0x11) & 0xfff` flipped all three (MATCH, #2282). At 0x4c0b10,
  `d += row * surf->pitch + span->x1;` in place of the cached `start` local
  (the same value) flipped the destination of the add (MATCH, #2223). This
  extends the "break a common subexpression" bullet at the end of the guide.
- **A missing duplicate statement can be what keeps a register live.** At
  0x499200 a second `field_2a44.value |= four;` at the end of the `else` arm
  let MSVC tail-merge the two copies into one `or word ptr [eax+0x2a44], di`,
  which keeps the constant 4 in `edi` for 600 bytes; with one copy it folds to
  `or byte ptr [..], 4` and `push 4` (#2284). A missing store leaves no trace in
  a call census; its symptom is a register that will not stay live.
- **A named intermediate must be used twice.** At 0x4ded60, naming the NT
  header pointer alone still folds into `lea ebx, [edx+eax+8]`; MSVC keeps
  `mov ecx, [eax+0x3c]; add ecx, eax; lea ebx, [ecx+8]` only when the pointer
  has two uses (`&pNT->FileHeader.TimeDateStamp` and a second read of the
  field). In the same function the two arms are deliberately different, one
  `p = buf + strlen(buf); sprintf(p, ...)` and one
  `sprintf(buf + strlen(buf), ...)`; making them alike loses 8 bytes. Try the
  asymmetric form before unifying two arms (MATCH, #2287).
- **Declare address locals first, then assign them in order.**
  `Vec3* op; Vec3* up; op = &order->pos; up = &unit->pos;` fixed both swapped
  `lea`s at 0x411f50, where declarations with initialisers let MSVC fold the
  order away (97.1%, #2553).
- **Route a two-level global chain through a local in each block.** At
  0x4936f0, `lyr = g_game->menu.layer; ents = lyr->entries;` let MSVC load the
  entries into the layer's register; `menu = &g_game->menu; lyr = menu->layer;
  ents = lyr->entries;` in both blocks gave the original's register rotation
  per block (MATCH, #1865).
- **Split a chained call on a singleton.** At 0x4daa30,
  `FUN_004da8d0()->FUN_004dd7d0(key)` evaluates the `lea ecx, [esp+0x10]`
  argument before the getter; `Class_004dd7d0* tree = FUN_004da8d0();
  tree->FUN_004dd7d0(key);` calls the getter first and keeps its result in
  `eax`, which put every later register in place (82.9% to MATCH, #2526). The
  opposite form, an inline method called on the call's result, was the right
  one at 0x4c5e70, so try both.
- **A statement's position decides what is live across a block.** At 0x451fd0
  a `memset` of the block placed after nine of the fourteen `= 4` stores kept
  the constant 4 live in `edx` across the `rep stosd`, as in the original
  (76.3% to 85.9% at the exact size). Every position from 1 to 13 scored the
  same and only 0 and 14 fell back, so measure a range of positions, not one
  (#2237).
- **An x87 clamp with a non-popping `fcom`** (`fcom; fnstsw ax; test ah, 0x41;
  jne; fstp [home]`) needs the result in a second double,
  `double b = (a > 0.0) ? a : 0.0;`; `if (!(a > 0.0)) a = 0.0;` gives `fst` plus
  `fcomp`. A divide emitted as `fxch st(1); fxch st(2); fxch st(1); fdiv st(2)`
  rather than `fdivp st(1)` needs the quotient computed inside a static inline
  helper that takes the divisor (0x4e0b90, MATCH, #2073).
- **A branchy 1/0 tail** (`mov eax, 1; jmp` ... `xor eax, eax; jmp`) rather
  than `xor eax, eax; cmp; setne al` needs a `static inline` helper with
  exactly one `return 1` and one `return 0`; every if/else, `? 1 : 0` and `&&`
  spelling gives `setne` (0x473a00, #2111).
- **A reversed member-wise subtraction hoists the load.** `b.x = a.x - b.x`
  (not `b.x -= a.x`) is the only spelling found that loads `b.x` before the
  prologue's `push ebx`; it costs 2 bytes because `a.x` can no longer be the
  destination. If your function is 2 bytes long with that hoist right, look
  for this shape (0x4851c0, #2109).
- **A loop offset kept in its own variable.** At 0x42dcf0 the `i * 0xbd`
  offset had to be a real `int off = 0;` advanced with `off += 0xbd`, whose
  creation order decides which of esi, edi, ebx and ebp it gets; spelling the
  offset inline did not match (MATCH, #2574). In the same pull request, an
  `unsigned short` field whose default is 0xffff let MSVC hoist one
  `mov esi, 0xffff` instead of an `or esi, -1` at each site (0x42e440).
- **A frame a whole number of dwords off.** MSVC 5 places a big local struct
  at the top of the frame (its base is the frame top minus its size), so a
  struct 4 bytes too small moves every `[esp+N]` by 4, and a trailing pad only
  grows the frame: fix the struct's real size (0x468cf0, #2150). A frame a
  dword short with an equal call census usually means a struct is missing a
  field: adding the Bitmap class's 4-byte tail turned `sub esp, 0x44` into the
  original's 0x48 at 0x483fa0 (#2276), and 0x497f40's 28-byte deficit was one
  4-byte local plus a `gadget` that is 48 bytes in the original, not 24
  (#2284).
- **One stack slot used by several values comes from merged variables, not
  slot reuse.** MSVC 5 never gives two plain locals the same slot, even when
  their lives do not overlap (0x4d0910, #2120; an inline helper's slots are the
  exception already noted). When the original's frame is a dword smaller, look
  for values the source kept in one variable: 0x4568c0 uses `[esp+0x14]` for an
  inlined loop's byte counter, a pointer and the returned flag (#2140), and
  reusing one byte local for two byte temporaries took 0x448c70's frame from
  0xdc to the original's 0xd4 (#2460).
- **A zero-initialisation inside a branch can free a slot.** At 0x41b2e0 the
  original zeroes `first` and `count` in the `else` branch rather than at the
  top, and that is what frees slot 0x10 for `onOff` (55.8% to 59.6%, #2269).
  If reordering declarations will not move a slot, check where the original
  first writes the variable.
- **Check a packed element's `sizeof` even when a pointer loop has the right
  stride.** A stray trailing byte is invisible to a walk with an explicit
  stride but breaks every indexed access; removing the byte at +0x15b fixed
  0x4a9fd0's indexed reads (#1945).
- **The twin test has four outcomes.** Compile the same source out of line, or
  compare with a matched copy of the same template elsewhere in the exe:
  (1) the twin uses a different instruction shape, so your shape has no
  matched compilation and the residual is unreachable (0x408f30 with
  0x4c4d70); (2) the twin agrees with your output, which points to a tie set by
  the inlining context (0x471de0, whose out-of-line twin 0x470fb0 matches with
  the opposite SIB byte, #2131), though 0x4d0f60 was in this class and still
  matched with fresh value numbers (#2282); (3) the twin shows the wanted form,
  so it is reachable and you are on a plateau (0x425210 with 0x488fb0, 0x4624a0
  with 0x435a20); (4) no twin can hold the difference (0x453360). Read the
  twin's notes too: a failure recorded in 0x481930's file pointed at 0x481d50's
  missing `do/while` (#2485, #2503, #2588).
- **A six-instruction shared loop latch gets duplicated.** At 0x4aeac0 all
  nine switch cases jump to one 6-instruction latch in the original, but MSVC 5
  copies it into every case (+148 bytes); a 7-instruction latch is not copied.
  /Os, /G3 to /G6, the RTM compiler and about 30 loop and switch shapes all
  failed, and a whole-exe scan found no other shared latch like it, so do not
  spend a normal budget on it (#2061, #2250; unsolved).
- **Two loops merged into one** where the original scans and then copies: a
  scan loop with a single condition can fold into the copy loop; a
  two-condition scan, `while (p != end && !(~p->flags.value & 0x800000)) p++;`,
  kept them apart at 0x42d2e0 (83.5% to 86.2%, #2555).
- **Stores after a call can stop tails merging.** At 0x47ae60, moving two
  `field_114 = 1` stores ahead of their `strcpy` calls let seven toggle arms
  share one inlined `strcpy` tail as in the original (79.9% to 84.2%, 2961 to
  2868 bytes, #2576).
- **Aggregate initialisers keep stores that assignments lose.**
  `struct HapiBuf sb = {20};` is the only shape found that gives 0x4bd160's
  fresh `xor ecx, ecx` (96.7% to 98.3%, #2187), and `Line_004de550 line =
  { 0x14 };` keeps 0x4de550's entry test and the initialiser's dead zero store
  (77.5% to 92.9%, then MATCH, #2526).
- **Copy STL template text verbatim.** Writing an insertion sort's backward
  copy exactly as MSVC 5's `<algorithm>` does, `while (_F != _L) *--_X = *--_L;`,
  flipped the loop test to the original's `cmp ebp, ebx` at 0x43bc90, where an
  equivalent hand-written loop did not (#2230).
- **The real `<vector>` can be required for a destructor epilogue.** At
  0x4223e0 only the real header's two-argument `allocator::deallocate` gives
  the original's `push ecx` local; a hand-written class with the same layout
  caps at 59.5% against 63.5%. Whether to hand-roll the vector or use the real
  header depends on which temporary is wrong, not on a general rule (#2050).
- **Delete a variable to test whether it matters.** If removing a local
  entirely gives byte-identical output, no spelling of it will change the
  register allocation; spend the budget elsewhere (0x4ac4c0, #2139).
- **A one-byte length difference can be a load encoding.** `mov eax, [G]` has
  a 5-byte form that only `eax` gets; in any other register the same load is
  6 bytes, which moves every later jump by one. If your function is exactly one
  byte long, check which register the global load went to (0x4c71f0, #2094;
  0x497f40, #2494). The fix is whatever puts that value in `eax`, not the
  expression.
- **A near `je` where the original has a short one** (`rel32` against `rel8`)
  means the code it jumps over is 30 to 40 bytes too long, not a compiler
  quirk. At 0x4b5cc0 moving the success path into a shared tail made both
  jumps short (89.3% to 92.7%, #2172), and the function has since matched.
- **Convert `esp` offsets to frame offsets before reporting a bug or a slot
  problem.** Every push since the prologue (saved registers, and the arguments
  of a call being built) adds 4 to an `[esp+N]` operand, a `__stdcall` callee
  removes its arguments on return, and whether `sub esp, N` comes before or
  after the register pushes changes the mapping. Most of the suspected bugs
  that failed review in one batch of 360 pull requests were this mistake: 0x4b5070, 0x4b5510,
  0x4dea00, 0x4db7d0, 0x4394e0, 0x4a81e0, 0x47e5c0 (retracted in #2228) and
  a withdrawn 0x43cd20 entry. It also produced a phantom slot transposition at
  0x438c00 (#2145) and a "local" that was a dead argument slot at 0x461fd0
  (#2106). In a `__chkstk` function, count from the big buffer's base (#2292).
- **A correct fix that lowers the score still belongs in the pull request.** At
  0x450240 adding the missing `i != 10` guard (a nested static inline getter,
  as in 0x44fe40, 0x44fed0 and 0x450380) dropped the score from 19.9% to 10.2%
  because the allocation changed (#2051); fixing three real errors at 0x4df590
  dropped it from 76.1% to 72.4% (#2073); and a higher-scoring 0x406300
  spelling is semantically wrong (#2539, #2594). Merging keeps the
  higher-scoring file, so name the correct form, with the lines it changes, in
  the file header and in the pull request.
- **A null test compiled as `lea reg, [base+K]; test reg, reg` is a bug to
  report.** It tests the address of a member array (`if (defs[type].name)`),
  which is never null, so its false arm is dead; list it under suspected
  original bugs (0x44c0d0, #1836; 0x44c7e0, #2593).
- **FUN_004b70ef and FUN_004b7123** (the fixed-point rotation routines) take
  the `short` angle first, `(short angle, int distance)`; the wrong order shows
  as a swapped `push` pair in every caller (0x49d270, #2181; see 0x406300.cpp).
- **The map behind 0x4daa30** is the `std::map` tree whose `_Ubound` is
  0x4dd7d0 and `_Dec` is 0x4dd820 (`_Nil` is DAT_00528a50; FUN_004da8d0 creates
  it on first use). Its value_type is the 0x30-byte Class_004d8820, keyed by
  its first dword; name the iterator Class_004dd820 (#2243, #2526).
