// 2026-10-02 (claude-opus-5-5): 90.8 -> 96.6%, exact size (1631 bytes). Two changes:
//  1. The second thumb loop updates ybase BEFORE lc (`ybase += mid->height;
//     lc -= mid->height;`): that is the original's latch order (`sub ecx,eax /
//     add esi,eax / mov [lc],ecx`, then `lim2 - height` for the test, with mid
//     kept in a register for the next draw). It fixes the "(b)" difference
//     below and the two extra bytes (90.8 -> 96.2).
//  2. The two limits are written `y + e->h - 1` and `x + e->w - 1`; the short
//     w/h locals still supply the registers, but y and x now take the lea base
//     as in the original (96.2 -> 96.6).
// Still differs: (a) below, unchanged (limit/lim2 and lc in each other's stack
// slots, 0x10 and 0x14; declaring lc before limit, at the top of the arm or at
// function scope, and reusing one variable for limit and lim2 are flat or
// worse), and (c) `add edi,-2` (`limit - g->width - 2`: `+ 1 ... - 3`,
// `- 2 - width`, `-2 + ...`, `b -= 2`, `b += -2`, `2u`, `2L` all give sub).
// 2026-10-02 (claude-sonnet-5-5): 84.2 -> 90.8%, 1633 bytes. The w<h/h<=w surface
// puzzle below was solved by changes that only work together:
//  1. each arm has its OWN `void* surf = Surface_004a2580(obj);` (the function-scope
//     `surface` is left for the gl==0 path and the flags&4 tail, where the
//     original reads [esp+0x1c]);
//  2. no Smaller(): in the w<h arm `int ybase = e->off + e->y + 3;` comes first (the
//     original's movsx [+0x140]/[+0x15] loads show ybase is computed BEFORE the size
//     compare; permute.py found ybase-first is worth +0.1), then
//     `int lc = (e->h - 6 < e->size) ? e->h - 6 : e->size;`. The ternary matters:
//     with `int lc = e->h - 6; if (lc >= e->size) lc = e->size;` (89.6%) MSVC keeps a
//     register copy of lc across the join (`mov ecx,edx`), with the ternary lc is
//     strictly in memory and reloaded (`mov eax,[esp+0x10]`) exactly like the original;
//  3. lim2 stays a plain if-min (a ternary there is byte-identical).
// With that, surf takes ebp in the w<h arm as in the original (the old gap was
// limit taking ebp), the frame is 0x40 again, and the structural ratio is 0.989.
// Still differs: (a) stack slots of the w<h arm: here limit 0x10 / lc 0x10 (shared) /
// lim2 0x14, the original has limit and lim2 both at 0x10 and lc at 0x14. The
// plain-if lc (89.6%) gets that slot order but loses the memory-only lc; one `limit`
// variable reused for lim2 gets lc 0x14 but then limit lands in the index home
// 0x58 and the glyph pointer in 0x10 (88.1%). Declaration order and scope of
// limit/lim2/lc/g/mid do not change which slot each gets. (b) the second loop
// computes `limit - mid->height` and updates lc/ybase in a different order
// (2 instructions). (c) `b = limit - g->width - 2` is `add edi,-2` in the original,
// `sub edi,2` here; `+ -2`, `b += -2` and `limit + -2 - w` all fold to sub.
// 2026-10-02 (Space Bunny Free), 81.7 -> 84.2%, two hunks from the permuter,
// each verified alone (limit-before-first alone is 83.8%, the `b` hoist alone
// 82.0%, together 84.2%):
//  - in the h<=w arm `int limit = x + w - 1;` comes BEFORE
//    `Glyph_004a2580* first = FUN_004b7f30(...)`, not after it.  Swapping only
//    these two statements is worth 2.1 points.
//  - `b` is declared as a function-scope `int b;` (no initialiser) and assigned
//    in the h<=w arm, rather than being a branch local.  The permuter found the
//    uninitialised declaration; giving it a name comment is fine because the
//    branch assigns it before every read.  Hoisting `a` the same way is inert.
//  Both changes are about where the allocator puts the h<=w temporaries, which
//  is what finally freed the register that the w<h branch's surface wants.
// Remaining gap is still one hunk: in the w<h arm the original enregisters the
// reloaded surface in ebp and homes `limit` at [esp+0x10], ours does the
// reverse (`limit` in ebp, surface at [esp+0x10], and every FUN_004b7f90 draw
// reloads it with `mov eax,[esp+0x1c]`).  The original's four scalar slots are
// limit 0x10, lc 0x14, entries 0x18, surface 0x1c; ours are surface 0x10,
// lc 0x14, entries 0x18 and one fewer.  Every declaration order of the four w<h
// locals is byte-identical, a branch-local `void* surf` draws its own frame slot
// (72.8%), hoisting `int limit` to function scope drops to 65.9%, and wrapping
// the whole arm in an inlined `static inline void DrawStack(e, surf)` is inert
// at 84.2%.  `Smaller` must stay reference-returning: a by-value `Min`, or a
// plain `if` for EITHER minimum, is 68-69%, so the `lea [esp+0x1c]` address
// temporaries it costs are required by the original's own code shape.
// 2026-10-01 (Space Bunny Free), 75.2 -> 80.6%, byte count exact at 1631 again:
//  - `e->w < e->h` is NOT the comparison in the source. The original emits
//    `mov cx,[ebx+0x17]; mov dx,[ebx+0x19]; cmp cx,dx` and then REUSES the
//    register copies inside the branches: `movsx edx,dx` for `y + h - 1` and
//    `movsx ecx,cx` for `x + w - 1`. That only happens when w and h are `short`
//    locals read again inside the two arms, so the else-if chain becomes an else
//    holding `short w = e->w; short h = e->h; if (w < h) {...} else {...}` with the
//    h<=w arm's limit written `x + w - 1`. Using the locals in only one arm, or
//    making them `int` (32-bit compare), or `unsigned short` (jb) all score lower
//    (75.2 / 75.5 / 72.1). This was worth 5.4 points on its own.
//  - the pointer chain `obj->holder->entries->u.head.surface` goes through a
//    `static inline void* Surface_004a2580(Object*)` getter at all three sites
//    (the guide's pointer-chain pattern), +0.3 and byte-identical to writing the
//    chain out. Doing it in one site only is the same, so it is not the lever.
// Remaining gap: still the frame slot for the function-scope `surface`
// ([esp+0x10] here, [esp+0x1c] in the original), which in turn makes the w<h
// branch keep `limit` in ebp where the original keeps the reloaded surface in ebp
// and homes `limit` at [esp+0x10]. Every declaration order of the four w<h locals
// tried is byte-identical (b0-b3 style), a branch-local `void* surf` draws its own
// frame slot and drops to 66%, and hoisting `int limit` first gives 64.9%.
// 2026-10-01 (Space Bunny Free), 69.8 -> 74.5%, three independent wins in the
// 2026-10-01 (Space Bunny Free): 69.8 -> 74.5%. Three independent wins, all in the
// flags&4 tail, all measured:
//  - the glyph-width measuring loop needs a real `unsigned char c` local, not the
//    `(unsigned char)*p` cast: the original stores the byte to the dead `obj` argument
//    home and reloads it (`mov byte [esp+0x54],al; mov ecx,[esp+0x54]; and ecx,0xff`),
//    which only a named byte local produces (72.4% alone, +11 bytes);
//  - `int total = 0;` belongs BEFORE the `char* text = buf` null test so that the zero
//    lands at `xor edi,edi` ahead of it (70.0% alone), and `p` is a second pointer
//    declared inside the `font != 0` arm so that `lea esi,[esp+0x20]` is only emitted
//    there (72.7% together). The null-tested pointer is `text`; the walked pointer is `p`.
//  - the _itoa float value must be a named `int num` computed in its own statement
//    before `_itoa(num, buf, 10)`: that makes MSVC finish the x87 chain before it starts
//    the shared argument pushes, which is the original's order (74.5%). Spelling the
//    same value inline inside the call interleaves `push 0xa; push ecx` between `fild`
//    and `fimul`. A named denominator (`int span`) instead is inert at 72.7%.
//  - and 74.5 -> 74.9: the SECOND minimum (`lim2 = Smaller(lim2, t)`) is a plain
//    `if (lim2 >= t) lim2 = t;`. The first one (`lc = Smaller(lc, e->size)`) has to stay
//    the reference-returning helper: making that a plain if too is 68.5% (1615 bytes),
//    and flipping either condition or writing the second as `lim2 < t ? lim2 : t` is
//    byte-identical to `if (lim2 >= t) lim2 = t`.
// Remaining gap, all in the w<h branch: the frame slot for the function-scope `surface`
// is [esp+0x10] here against [esp+0x1c] in the original, and the allocator gives ebp to
// `limit` here and to the reloaded surface there, so the three draws in that branch
// reload `surface` from the stack (`mov eax,[esp+0x10]; push eax`, 4 bytes each) where
// the original pushes ebp. That is the whole +11 byte excess. Still worth trying: a
// branch-local surface variable in the w<h arm (63.1%, it draws its own frame slot),
// `short w/h` locals for the two-register branch compare (69.8%, inert), a by-value
// `Smaller(int,int)` (62.4%, 1604 bytes, drops the reference temps but moves `entries`
// to 0x14), and `e->x + e->w + 2` vs `e->w + e->x + 2` in the FUN_004c14f0 call (both
// still load x and w in the opposite order to the original).
// 2026-10-01 retry 8 (deepseek-v4.1-flash, #3660): best is still 69.8% (the form below).
// New measurements, all scored:
//  - The w<h register tie is real and use-count sensitive, but only for a BRANCH-LOCAL
//    surface. In v1 (branch-local surf) one extra FUN_004b7f90(surf,...) call flips the
//    allocator exactly as the original wants (surf -> ebp, limit -> a home, probes p3/p4/p6),
//    while the same extra call on the function-scope surface form (z2) does NOT flip: a
//    function-scope surface that is live from the top is never a register candidate, so its
//    use count is irrelevant. The original's w<h surface therefore IS a separate variable.
//  - q1 (entries/e declared before surface, branch-local surf) reproduces the ORIGINAL
//    prologue instruction for instruction (surface load 0x4a25b5, store to [esp+0x1c],
//    entries at [esp+0x18]) but the frame grows to 0x44 because the w<h temps and the h<=w
//    surf take a fresh [esp+0x20] slot instead of reusing limit's/lc's; the branch-local surf
//    still loses ebp to limit, 64.7%. Adding the extra use to q1 (q1p) does flip surf to ebp
//    but the frame/slot order stays wrong (limit at 0x14, lc/temp at 0x10) and the score
//    falls to 63.9%. So the flip alone is not enough: the original's frame has exactly four
//    scalar slots (limit 0x10, lc 0x14, entries 0x18, surface 0x1c) and NO slot for the
//    enregistered surf, which only happens if surf is enregistered without a home.
//  - Tested and inert: v1/v8/v9/v10/v12/v15/v16, w1 (inline Draw wrapper), w2/w3 (inline
//    wrapper with its own redundant g!=0 check, the guide's 0x4bcb50 shape), s1/s3
//    (surf=surf), f3/f4 (folded uses), v14a/b and u1/u2 (uninitialised declarations), v18
//    (shared function-scope limit), v17 (one surface variable for all three branches), v19
//    (separate function-scope vsurf for the branch only), v20 (inline Surface(obj) getter),
//    v21 (branch-local named surface, shadowing), v22 (whole w<h branch in an inline helper
//    taking the surface as a parameter), declaration order permutations o1-o4, q1-q3, z1,
//    r1 (lc declared first), x1/x2 (short operands, flipped condition), v11a/v11b (hoisted
//    limit/lc), w3/m1/m2 (Min by reference, i.e. inline-if min shape), m3.
//  - p7 (an extra real use of limit in the loop test) does NOT flip it either, so the tie is
//    not a plain use count of the two variables; the p3/p4/p6 flips changed a whole block's
//    shape, not just a count.
// Remaining gap: the w<h branch wants its own surface variable enregistered in ebp with no
// frame home, so limit/lc/lim2 stay in the 0x10/0x14 slots and the inline-if min shape
// (not the Smaller reference shape the current 69.8% uses) can match. A natural construct
// that gives that variable one more counted use without emitting code (the guide's 0x4bcb50
// pattern) is still missing.
// 2026-10-01 retry 7 (deepseek-v4.1-flash, #3660): kept 69.8%. New measurements, all scored:
//  - declaring `entries` first and initialising `surface` from it compiles byte-identically
//    to the stored form (1631 bytes, same slots: surface 0x10, lc 0x14, entries 0x18, min
//    temp 0x1c, loop pointer in the freed index home 0x58), so the declaration order of the
//    two entry pointers is not a lever.
//  - deferring the surface definition to a plain assignment after `e = &entries[index]`
//    (tested with the declaration first and after e) reproduces the ORIGINAL prologue
//    instruction for instruction through 0x4a25a1 (entries), the lea chain, 0x4a25b5 (load)
//    and 0x4a25c2 (store), but the allocator then homes `surface` in the freed index home
//    [esp+0x58] and gives the loop pointer [esp+0x14]: the exact swap of the original, 67.6%.
//    Adding hoisted `int limit; int lc;` (with or without forced initial values, which get
//    dead-code eliminated) on top is still 67.6% / 69.8% and does not move the surface.
//  - an explicit `Entry_004a2580* p = &entries[1]` walking pointer drops to 55.1%.
//  - a by-value `inline int Smaller(int,int)` (instead of the const int& form) drops to
//    62.4% with 1604 bytes: the reference form is what produces the shared 26-byte _itoa tail.
// Remaining gap: the allocator's home for the function-scope `surface`, ours [esp+0x10] and
// the original [esp+0x1c] (which in the original frees 0x10 for the w<h `limit`, keeps the
// reloaded surface in ebp through that branch and leaves no min temp at 0x1c).
// 2026-10-01 retry 6 (deepseek-v4.1-flash): six more levers tested, none beat 69.8%.
// Hoisting limit/lc as function-scope locals before entries/surface (the slot order the
// original shows is limit 0x00, lc 0x04, entries 0x08, surface 0x0c) gives 67.6%: the surface
// then lands in the freed index home [esp+0x58] and the scan loop pointer takes its frame slot.
// Reordering the prologue so entries/e are computed before the surface load gives 67.6% too,
// and adding a fresh branch-local surface in the w<h branch on top gives 64.7%. A fresh w<h
// branch-local surface alone gives 63.1% whether it is declared before or after `int y = e->y`
// (it gets a home, local 0x0c, instead of ebp); naming the branch test operands `short w/h`
// gives 62.6%; plain ifs instead of Smaller() in the lc/lim2 block give 62.4% (1604 bytes, the
// shared 26-byte _itoa tail merge is lost); a plain if for lc only gives 62.3% (1616 bytes);
// moving the h<=w surf declaration after x/y gives 58.4%. Conclusion: in the original the
// function-scope surface keeps slot 0x0c while the w<h branch draws through a register (ebp)
// copy, and MSVC only awards that register when the branch variable has no stack home, which
// our formulations never achieve (they either keep the home or spend a local frame slot).
// 2026-10-01 retry 5 (deepseek-v4.1-flash): best stays 69.8%, 1631 bytes. A fresh branch-local surface (with and without a const function-scope surface) gives 63.1%; hoisting function-scope `int limit; int lc;` before entries/surface lands the surface in the freed [esp+0x58] home at 67.6%; the w<h test cast to unsigned short is byte-identical. Still differs: surface home [esp+0x10] vs the original [esp+0x1c] and the w<h register split (surface in ebp vs our stack home).
// Sonnet 5.5 (#3246): re-checked 69.8%. Turning r1/r2/rect from int[4] into a `Rect` struct (and
// the callee parameters to Rect*) is byte-identical, so the frame/slot differences are not an
// array-versus-struct question.
//
// 2026-10-01 (deepseek-v4.1-flash, 67.5 -> 69.8, both 1631 bytes): the 26-byte
// gap was the _itoa dispatch. Splitting the value computation into three
// separate `_itoa(...)` calls (float path, flags&8 path, plain off path)
// instead of computing a single `int v` first reproduces the original's
// tail-merged shared `call _itoa` and closes the byte count. Still differs
// (not byte-identical): the frame slot for the function-scope `surface` is
// [esp+0x10] in ours versus [esp+0x1c] in the original (original keeps w<h
// `limit` at [esp+0x10] and the branch surface/lc at [esp+0x14] with
// `entries` at [esp+0x18]); in the w<h branch the original keeps the reloaded
// surface in ebp and reloads obj from [esp+0x54] afterwards. Reordering the
// surface/entries declarations was tried and does not move the slot.
//
// 2026-09-30 retry (deepseek-v4.1-flash, 67.5%): tested two more allocator
// levers, neither beat 67.5%, so kept the current form. Declaring `entries`
// then `surface` (vB) gives 65.2%, declaring a function-scope `int limit`
// before `surface` (vC) is identical at 67.5%. The surface load is scheduled
// at function entry no matter where its declaration sits. Still differs: the
// original homes `surface` at [esp+0x1c] and keeps it in ebp through the w<h
// branch, while ours homes it at [esp+0x10] and keeps `limit` in ebp; the
// branch test operand order (`mov cx,[w]; mov dx,[h]` vs ours
// `mov cx,[h]; cmp [w],cx`) and the missing 26 bytes in the flags&4 block
// (the three _itoa setups do not tail-merge) remain.
//
// 2026-09-30 (deepseek-v4.1): 65.2 -> 67.5 by declaring the function-scope
// `void* surface` FIRST among the locals (before `entries`/`e`), so it is
// loaded at entry into a real frame slot ([esp+0x10] for us; the original
// keeps it at [esp+0x1c]) instead of the freed index home [esp+0x58]. Slot
// choice for spilled locals is declaration-order sensitive here: moving an
// unrelated branch local's declaration earlier (`int limit` before `surf` in
// the h<=w branch) drops to 54.5%, `int n/i` before surface gives 67.3%, a
// fresh per-branch surface local gives 62.3%, one hoisted shared `int limit`
// is neutral at 65.2. Still differs (1605 bytes against 1631):
//  - w<h branch: ours spills its surface to [esp+0x58] and keeps `limit` in
//    ebp; the original keeps the surface in ebp, `limit` at [esp+0x10] and
//    the glyph pointers at [esp+0x58] (the freed index home).
//  - the w<h test: original `mov cx,[w]; mov dx,[h]; cmp cx,dx; jge`, ours
//    `mov cx,[h]; cmp [w],cx; jge` (flipping `<` to `>` was tried, no change).
//  - h<=w branch: our spare slot assignments ([esp+0x14] for both the w<h
//    limit and the h<=w surf) differ from the original's [esp+0x10] limit /
//    [esp+0x14] surf pattern.
//  - 26 bytes short, mostly in the flags&4 block, where the three _itoa
//    argument setups do not tail-merge the way the original's do.
// Retry 2026-09-30 (deepseek-v4.1-flash): kept the 65.2% v11 form. Re-tested
// moving the function-scope `surface` load down to just before FUN_004a23b0
// (the point of first use), which drops to 63.9%, so reverted. No new lever
// found; remaining diff is the two-slot swap described below plus the w<h
// branch keeping obj in ebp instead of the branch surface.
// Gave up near 62.3% (1605 bytes against 1631). Reload glyph pointers
// after callbacks. Reference-returning minimum helpers recover remaining-count
// stores, and shared glyph locals improve allocation. Remaining extra frame
// slot, glyph spills, and branch/scheduling differences.
//
// 2026-09-30 (deepseek-v4.1), 61.3% -> 62.3%: give each branch its own
// `void* surf` local instead of one function-scope one. That puts the h<=w
// surface at [esp+0x14] (frame 0x04, shared with lc) and the glyph pointers in
// the dead index home slot [esp+0x58], exactly as the original. Source kept as
// build/scratch/0x4a2580/v3.cpp.
//
// 2026-09-30 (deepseek-v4.1), 62.3% -> 65.2%: the w<h branch must not declare
// its own `void* surf`; assign the function-scope `surface` instead
// (`surface = obj->holder->entries->u.head.surface;`) and draw through it.
// That removes the extra frame dword (frame is now 0x40, buf at [esp+0x20] as
// in the original) and kills the whole +4 offset family of diffs. Source kept
// as build/scratch/0x4a2580/v11.cpp. Doing the same in the h<=w branch drops to
// 60.1% (v12), and dropping the reload chain in w<h drops to 52.8% (v13), so
// only the w<h branch wants this form.
//
// 2026-09-30 (deepseek-v4.1), retried four allocator levers, all worse than the
// 65.2% above, so the file keeps the v11 form:
//  - w<h with its own `void* vsurf` local (the ebp surface the original shows):
//    62.3%. Same for a distinct local name; a shared local is what the
//    allocator awards the freed param home slot.
//  - `surface` declared after the loop counters: 64.8%, slot assignment
//    unchanged ([esp+0x58] surface, [esp+0x14] walking pointer).
//  - `(int)e->w < (int)e->h` and `e->h > e->w`: 64.8%, same single hunk.
//  - explicit `Entry_004a2580* p = entries;` used by the scan loop: identical
//    codegen, p is optimised into the same induction pointer.
// The original's `mov cx,[w]; mov dx,[h]; cmp cx,dx` versus ours
// `mov cx,[h]; cmp [w],cx` is not steerable from the condition text; it is the
// same global allocation choice that puts surface at [esp+0x1c] there and
// [esp+0x58] here (the freed `index` home slot), so ebp keeps obj here and
// holds the branch surface there.
// Still differs (1605 bytes against 1631):
//  - slot swap: the original homes the loop's walking entry pointer at the dead
//    index slot [esp+0x58] and `surface` at [esp+0x1c]; ours homes `surface` at
//    [esp+0x58] and the pointer at [esp+0x14]. The original keeps the w<h
//    surface in ebp (and reloads the obj parameter into ebp after the branch at
//    0x4a29ef) while ours spills it to [esp+0x58] and keeps `limit` in ebp.
//    Writing `limit`/`t` as plain ifs instead of the Smaller() helper removes
//    the reference temps but not the extra allocation (56.1%), so this is the
//    allocator's pick, not a source-order lever.
//  - the branch test: original is `mov cx,[ebx+0x17]; mov dx,[ebx+0x19];
//    cmp cx,dx; jge` (both operands in registers), ours loads h into cx and
//    compares w from memory; flipping `<` to `>` did not change it.
//  - ours is 26 bytes shorter, most of it in the flags&4 block (the -430/+434
//    hunk), where the two _itoa call sites are not fully tail-merged.
