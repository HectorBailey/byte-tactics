// Decompiled by Space Bunny Free. Names are provisional.
// Frame rate counter: adds the time since the last call to the counter, and once
// a second stores the number of frames in that second as the frame rate. When
// there is no offscreen GDI device context it draws "FRATE <rate>" over the
// frame through the surface's device context.
//
// 96.7%, 294 of 294 bytes, so every instruction is the right size and the
// frame, the six reloads and the register choices are right. All three
// differences are the same thing: where the reload of the address-taken local
// `dc` sits inside the argument block of its call, the original lets it sink
// one or two instructions further down than ours:
//   +0x95 the original loads the hoisted SelectObject import into esi before
//        reloading dc, ours reloads dc first;
//   +0xdc the original emits `lea ecx,[buf]`, `push ebx` and only then reloads
//        dc, ours reloads dc before the lea;
//   +0xf1 the original pushes the old font before reloading dc, ours reloads
//        dc first.
// The registers and the displacements agree in all three places (edx/eax and
// [esp+0xc] shifted by 4 for each push), so this is a scheduling tie-break,
// not a different source value. The other three calls (SetBkMode at +0x83,
// SetTextColor at +0xc0, EndDraw at +0x105) put the reload first in both.
//
// What the source below already gets right, and what the three diffs must not
// disturb: the frame is exactly filled. The .lst of this file shows
// `_dc$29020 = -132` and `_buf$29021 = -128`, so the 132 bytes the prologue
// reserves are 4 bytes of `dc` at the bottom plus the 128-byte buffer above it
// and nothing else: there is no room for a third local, and the "four
// HKEY/HDC locals at [esp+0x10] to [esp+0x1c]" that the frame sizes seem to
// suggest are the buffer, not locals. The address-taken `dc` is reloaded after
// every one of the six calls; the SelectObject import is hoisted into esi
// because it is called twice; the wsprintf result is kept in ebx; and the
// vtable load `mov edx,[eax]` comes after the pushes of both __stdcall
// methods, which is why those two slots must be __stdcall.
//
// A /Fa listing of this file shows that MSVC 5.0 emits the whole argument
// block of a call under one statement, and that in this build it does not move
// anything inside a block: our order is the plain source order, the reload of
// `dc` first, in all six calls. So the original's compiler had three of those
// reloads at a lower priority than the neighbouring import load, buffer lea
// and register push. Nothing in this function's source shape moved them.
// Compiled and diffed instruction by instruction, all byte-identical to this
// file: swapping the two local declarations; putting both locals in one local
// struct and using its fields; reading the local through a `HDC*`; an inline
// helper taking `HDC&` or `HDC*` for the whole drawing block; inline helpers
// for the font read, the rate read, SetBkMode, TextOut, the GetDC call and the
// `&dc`; about fifteen spellings (`== 0` against `!`, TRANSPARENT against 1,
// RGB(255,255,0) against 0xffff, wsprintf against wsprintfA, TextOut against
// TextOutA, split declarations and assignments, `== NULL` for the offscreen
// test, DWORD against unsigned int, `+=` against `= ... +`); 0 to 12 and 500
// extern declarations, 2000 unused prototypes and an unrelated function placed
// ahead of this one; and all 128 header sets headers.py tries.
//
// A second sweep (Space Bunny Free, #519) added, all byte-identical again:
// `HDC*`/`HDC&`/`HDC`-by-value inline helpers for the drawing block; a helper
// taking the surface, font and rate; helpers for SetBkMode and for TextOut
// alone; the two locals declared at the top of the function; an extra nested
// brace level; `void*` for `dc` with casts at every use; `unsigned int` and
// `short` for the length; `&buf[0]`, `(char*)buf` and `LPSTR` for the buffer
// argument; keeping the results of SetBkMode and the second SelectObject in a
// variable; `(int)`/`COLORREF` casts on the constants; `== NULL` and `!` for
// the GetDC test; `TextOutA`; braces on the `if` bodies; `++c->frames`;
// a temporary for the tick delta; and a temporary for the returned rate. The
// only variants that moved at all were the ones that change the function's
// shape for real: a helper taking `HDC` by value (57.8%, the copy of `dc`
// stops being the address-taken local so the reloads go away), a helper
// taking the surface and font (54.4%), and returning `c->rate` instead of
// re-reading the global (77.6%, the original really does reload the global
// for the return value).
//
// The three reloads are therefore very likely decided by compiler state this
// function's own source cannot reach, most likely the register allocator's
// state left by whatever Cavedog compiled just before it in the same
// translation unit, which docs/AGENTS.md expects to be recoverable when
// functions are regrouped into their original translation units.
