// Decompiled by deepseek-v4.1-flash. Names are provisional.
// Finds the highest field_4 among the active players of type 1 or 3, then
// looks that player up by field_4 and sets bit 0 of its info flags. The
// player lookup is inlined and its index search appears twice.
//
// PARTIAL (19.9%): the instruction sequence and struct offsets are right, but
// MSVC picks different registers here. The original keeps g_game in edi, max
// in ebp, the max-loop countdown in esi and the constant 10 in eax/al (the
// lookup's "no player" sentinel), so the max loop walks with ecx and the
// inlined search reuses esi as scratch. Our compile keeps g_game in esi, max
// in edi, the countdown in edx and the loop base in eax. The inlined search
// also loses the "cmp bl,al; je" entry guard the original has before each of
// its two loops (0x44fed0, whose helper is otherwise identical, keeps it).
//
// Notes from a second attempt (Claude Opus 5.5, #195):
// - Wrong source shape, not compiler state: with 0 to 400 unused extern
//   declarations in front, this file scores 19.9% at every N, and every
//   header set from tools/headers.py leaves it unchanged.
// - The lookup is the neighbour FUN_0044fed0 inlined: defining the real
//   FUN_0044fe40 (index search, 0x44fe40's PlayerId getter keyed on +0x73)
//   and FUN_0044fed0 (returns 0 when the index is 10, else &players[index])
//   above this function, and writing
//       Player* q = FUN_0044fed0(max); if (q) q->info->flags |= 1;
//   reproduces the whole instruction stream, entry guards included, with
//   only registers differing (it scores 10.1% to 13.8%, lower than this file,
//   because more of its registers differ). The max loop's pointer walk and
//   "mov bl, 3" also come out right.
// - What never appears is the constant 10 held in eax for the whole function
//   (mov eax, 0xa; mov esi, eax for the countdown; cmp bl, al in the
//   searches). Types of max, the id field, the getter return and both
//   parameters, index vs pointer loops, IsType(p, 3) || IsType(p, 1)
//   helpers, an inline max helper, declaration order and else-if bodies
//   all leave 10 as an immediate. Even extra uses of 10 inside the max loop
//   do not enregister it, so the missing piece is probably something else
//   in the original source that ties up the scratch registers differently.
//
// Notes from a third attempt (deepseek-v4.1-flash, #1332):
// - Rebuilt the inlined lookup exactly like the matched 0x44fed0 helper
//   (GetPlayerField_00450240 with the explicit "i != 10" guard, then
//   FindPlayerIndex, then an inlined GetPlayer). That version is 302 bytes
//   (original is 305) and the whole instruction stream, guards and all,
//   lines up; only the registers differ, and it scores 10.1% because every
//   register operand then mismatches. tools/headers.py tried all 128 sets,
//   all stay at 10.1%.
// - The linchpin is the constant 10: the original occupies eax with it for
//   the whole function, which forces the max-loop countdown into a
//   callee-saved register (esi), which in turn forces max into ebp (edi holds
//   g_game). When 10 stays an immediate, edx is free for the countdown and
//   eax for the loop base, which is exactly our wrong allocation.
