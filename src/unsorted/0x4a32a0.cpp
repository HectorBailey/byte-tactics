// Decompiled by space-bunny-free, finished by deepseek-v4.1-flash. Names are provisional.
// UPDATE (78.1 percent, 762 bytes): the type-4 search in the second half is
// really an inlined helper `FindType(entries, kind)` that returns 0 on a miss
// (its `return i;` gives `mov ebp, eax; jmp`, its `return 0;` gives
// `xor ebp, ebp`). Writing the loop out inline instead hoisted the zero to
// before the loop and spilled the matched byte to the stack; the helper makes
// the loop and almost everything after it instruction for instruction.
// Still differs: the first half has `count` in edi and the shared zero in ebx,
// the original has `count` in ebx and the zero in edi; that swap is what keeps
// `found` in ebx instead of ebp (ebp is then free for the third search's entry
// array) and leaves the DAT_0051fba4 reload order in the last block different.
// The rest of the old notes below are the 69.9 attempt, kept for history.
//
// OLD NOTES: The push ecx frame IS produced by reusing the PARAM_1 slot as the row-fitting
// counter: param_1 = (Class_004a32a0*)(int)me->height; and the loop and the
// later remain < 0 tests work on (int)param_1. A modified parameter has a
// live stack home, so the holder needs a real frame dword, exactly the
// original's [esp+0x10]. The cast is ugly; the original may have declared the
// first parameter differently. (2) The +0xda raise is the field compared as
// (f_da > FH+1) ? f_da :
// FH+1 (true arm is the field), not the <= form.
// Still differs: count is in ebx and the zero register in edi in the original;
// ours has them swapped (edi/ebx), which spills kind to [esp+0x1c] in the
// type-4 search and puts found in ebx instead of ebp. Tried without effect:
// swapping f_ba/f_bc order, if (flag), step as a ?:, moving the first store
// after the height load, reusing name for the text pointer, a shared last
// local (worse, 51.0). Calling convention (ret 0x14) is correct, not the cause.
// PARTIAL, 61.2 percent by check.py (769 bytes against the original's 765,
// 248 instructions against 249). The whole shape is the original's: the
// entry-name search loop, the "Error in GUI layout" miss path, the font-height
// block, the row-fitting loop and all three later searches compile to the
// original's instruction sequences, and the prologue and the whole first
// search loop are instruction for instruction the original's.
//
// What the function does: finds the layout entry called `name`, and gives it a
// bitmap (+0xc2), a row count (+0xc0) and, when `flag` is non-zero, an id
// (+0xd6) with bit 11 of +0x1b set. It then makes the entry's line height at
// +0xda at least the font height plus one, zeroes +0xbc and +0xba, and walks the
// row counter down from count-1 while the rows still fit the entry's height
// (+0x19), each step consuming the line height, stopping at the first row that
// does not fit. If the byte at +0x29 is set it then looks the same entry up
// again, takes its +0x01 byte, finds the first entry of type 4 with that byte,
// looks THAT entry's name up in the language list and selects it; and if the
// row walk ran out of room it scrolls the list. An entry that is not found is
// reported and then treated as a null entry.
//
// The one thing that is still wrong is the frame. The original reserves one
// dword (`push ecx` in the prologue) and keeps `param_1->holder` in it: the
// store is `mov [esp+0x10], eax` at 0x4a32b8 and the two reloads are
// `mov eax, [esp+0x10]` at 0x4a3449 and 0x4a3491. This source gets the same
// store and the same two reloads but MSVC puts them in the DEAD param_1 slot
// instead, so it emits no `push ecx` at all and every `[esp+N]` displacement in
// the function is 4 too small. The prologue and first loop are otherwise
// instruction for instruction the original's, including the order
// `mov ebp, [esp+0x18]` (the name) before `push edi`, `mov edi, 1` for the
// counter, `mov esi, [eax+4]` for the entry array and then the spill.
//
// The full slot map of the original, with esp = entry_esp - 20 after the five
// prologue pushes, which is worth having because every value is homed in a
// dead argument slot except the holder:
//   [esp+0x10] = entry_esp - 4  = the `push ecx` frame dword, the holder
//   [esp+0x18] = entry_esp + 4  = param_1's dead slot, `remain`
//   [esp+0x1c] = entry_esp + 8  = the name's dead slot, `text`
//   [esp+0x24] = entry_esp + 0x10 = the count's dead slot, the language root
// so the original's home for `remain` is the dead PARAM_1 slot, which is why
// the holder had to go to a real frame slot: the two are live at the same time
// (the holder's last use is 0x4a3491, `remain` is stored at 0x4a33dc) and the
// name's slot is still live at 0x4a33dc (name is used again at 0x4a3469), so
// there is only one free dead slot at that point.
//
// What did NOT force the frame (all tried, all still no `push ecx`, all at
// 61.2% or worse): declaring `holder` and `entries` at the top, declaring them
// in the other order, spelling the later uses as `param_1->holder->entries` so
// the holder is an unnamed CSE temp again, hoisting `remain` and `text` to
// function scope, adding a `Root* root = DAT_0051fba4` local in the last block
// so a fourth value needs a home, passing the holder to the search helper
// instead of the array, and copying `name` into a local. Declaring `remain` as
// `short` rather than `int` DOES produce `push ecx` and lands the holder in the
// frame slot exactly as the original does, but it is wrong: the original
// sign-extends the height into a full dword (`movsx edi, word [esi+0x19]`,
// `sub edi, ecx`, `mov [esp+0x18], edi`), and the short version then stores only
// a word, and it scores worse besides (57.0%).
//
// Facts worth keeping for anyone finishing this:
// - The 0x15b entry: +0x00 type byte, +0x01 the byte the type-4 search matches,
//   +0x02 the 16-byte name, +0x19 the height the rows are fitted into, +0x1b
//   the flag word, +0x29 a byte that gates the whole second half, +0xb6 the
//   entry count (entry 0 only), +0xba, +0xbc, +0xbe the first fitting row,
//   +0xc0 the row count, +0xc2 the bitmap, +0xd6 the id, +0xda the line height.
// - `param_1->holder` is +0x18 and `holder->entries` is +0x04, so the first
//   instruction pair is `mov eax, [eax+0x18]` then `mov esi, [eax+4]`.
// - The name search is the `FindEntry` helper of 0x4a0180 / 0x4a0200 /
//   0x4a0280 / 0x4a35a0, inlined. Spelled as an inlined helper returning -1
//   the `or reg, 0xffffffff` lands AFTER the loop, where the original has it;
//   written as `int index = -1; for (...) { index = i; break; }` it is hoisted
//   to the top of the function and the whole register allocation changes.
// - The font height expression (`FUN_004c1450()` when the language list is
//   null, else the glyph for 0x49 plus two) is written THREE times in the
//   source: once inside the `?:` that raises +0xda (both arms recompute it, so
//   it must be spelled with the expression in both arms), once for the
//   `step`, and it must be an expression, not a local, or the second copy is
//   common-subexpression-eliminated away.
// - The stores after the entry is found are `+0xc0`, `+0xc2`, then `+0x1b`,
//   and the original reads +0x1b into edx BEFORE the `or edx, 0x10` and stores
//   it after both other stores, so the flag store is last in the source.
// - `xor edi, edi` at 0x4a3340 makes edi the zero register for the whole next
//   block: `cmp eax, edi` twice, `mov word [esi+0xbc], di`,
//   `mov word [esi+0xba], di` and `cmp eax, edi` for the flag test all read it.
// - The `?:` that raises +0xda compares `me->f_da <= FontHeight() + 1`, with
//   the field first, and stores back through the same `mov word [esi+0xda], ax`
//   from both arms, so the two arms must compute the same 16-bit store.
// - The type-4 search keeps the found index in ebp and tests `ebp == -1` even
//   though the loop can only leave 0 or a positive index there; the zero comes
//   from `xor ebp, ebp` placed at the loop's join, so `int found = 0;` with the
//   `if (found == -1)` test after the loop is what produces it. The +0x01 byte
//   it matches is read from a THIRD derivation of the entry array, loaded from
//   the holder at 0x4a3491 and kept in esi through the whole loop, and it stays
//   in `dl` for the loop; `holder` itself is dead by then, so the array has to
//   be a fresh local here, not `holder->entries`, or one more value is live in
//   the loop and the byte gets spilled to the stack instead of held in `dl`.
// - `remain` is a real local that lives in the dead param_1 slot: it is stored
//   twice (`mov [esp+0x18], edi` at 0x4a33dc before the row loop and again at
//   0x4a343a after it) and read twice at 0x4a3562 and 0x4a3579.
// - The last two arguments are pushed from the stack slots, not from registers:
//   `push edx` (the `setl` of `(int)param_1 < 0`), `push esi` (the found index in the
//   language list) and `push eax` (the language root) for FUN_004a03f0.
//
// Suspected original bug: none found beyond the dead `found == -1` test above,
// which is harmless. The `+0xda` minimum is applied twice (once by the `?:`
// that raises it, once by the `me->f_da == 0` test that computes the step), so
// the step is never zero, which looks deliberate.
