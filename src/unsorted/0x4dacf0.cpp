// Decompiled by deepseek-v4.1, finished by deepseek-v4.1-flash. Names are provisional.
// Started by space-bunny-free, continued by deepseek-v4.1-flash and GPT-6; deepseek-v4.1 retry.
// NOT A MATCH: measured 52.2 percent, ours 778 bytes against the original 780, frame 0x68 (correct,
// and every callee/data reference resolves at the same place). The body is instruction for
// instruction right except for register allocation:
//   * the original homes lock/need/want/wraps in edi/ebx/ebp/esi and keeps res (E+0x24) in memory
//     only; this build homes lock and map in ebx, want in edi, res in ebp and need in memory at
//     E+0x20, and the loop counter wraps shares ebp as the zero source.
//   * consequences of that one difference: `cmp dword ptr [map+0xc],esi / jbe` becomes
//     `cmp dword ptr [map+0xc],ebp / jbe`; `push 0` for the record ctor's last argument becomes
//     `push ebp`; the pad branch's `lea eax,[ebx+edi]` becomes `lea ecx,[ebx+edi]`; the b iterator
//     home slides from E+0x1c to E+0x10 (n2 stays at E+0x14); the early `mov dword ptr [esp+0x24],0`
//     becomes `xor ebp,ebp / mov [esp+0x24],ebp`.
//   * tried without effect: removing the `= 0` initialisers on base/len/key, splitting one Pair into
//     the two the original has, swapping the iterator declarations, `wraps` before `map`, the
//     `!(a == b)` Neq form, and changing the local declaration order. Every attempt leaves the
//     ebx/ebp/edi assignment as above, so this looks like MSVC5 allocator state the local source
//     does not steer (same class as 0x4a6ae0 and 0x4866d0).
// GPT-6 retry: repaired shared page commitment for reused blocks, zeroed base on
// failed reservation, fixed the 48-byte record layout and iterator hidden-return ABI, and corrected
// matched callee owners. Earlier notes below describe the superseded reconstruction. Progress over the 49.7 percent version came from removing the `= 0`
// initialisers on base/len/key (the original does not zero them, and the extra zero store was the
// spilled home that both pushed the frame to 0x6c and took the register allocation away from
// map/wraps) and from splitting the one Pair into the two the original has
// (p at E+0x30, the lower_bound query q at E+0x38), plus masking n before the
// negate in pad.
// The frame is still 0x6c where the original is 0x68: our locals relative to E
// match the original exactly (res 0x24, lock 0x28, need 0x2c, p 0x30, q 0x38,
// ins 0x40, rec 0x48) but E sits 4 bytes lower, so the extra dword is reserved
// above the record, most likely a distinct hidden-return slot for the
// FUN_004dbd00(cur) erase call (the original aliases it onto E+0x30, the p
// slot). Changing the local declaration order changes nothing.
// Worked: want/need split as a Pair; no `= 0` on base/len/key; base loaded from
// DAT_005289d4 before the `if (base == 0)`; pad = (0 - (n & 0xfff)) & 0xfff.
// Still differs: frame 0x6c; the record ctor's last argument is pushed as a
// register (ebp) instead of the immediate 0; a lea lands in ecx where the
// original uses eax in the commit path.
// The original's frame (E = esp after `sub esp,0x68` and the four pushes):
//   0x10 want        0x14 n2 (lower_bound out)   0x18 cur    0x1c b, then
//   reused as prev  0x20 len   0x24 res   0x28 the CRITICAL_SECTION pointer,
//   then `need` (both use that one home)   0x2c NOT referenced at all, a
//   genuine hole   0x30/0x34 the pair, which is ALSO the hidden-return slot of
//   FUN_004dbe10, FUN_004dbd80 and FUN_004dbd00 (all three pass &slot first
//   and 0 second)   0x38/0x3c the lower_bound query pair   0x40 the insert
//   result, reused for the second map's insert   0x48 the 48-byte record, whose
//   tail overlaps the four saved registers (0x4d8849 stores the 4th ctor
//   argument to [esi+0x2c] = E+0x74 = saved edi, which the epilogue pops and
//   discards, so the original gets away with it).
// What worked (all scored free with `check.py --sym`):
//   * `FUN_004da780()` returns the CRITICAL_SECTION pointer itself, and the
//     size argument is NOT written back: `unsigned int size = n; if (!size)
//     size = 1;`. That gives the original's `test esi,esi / jne / mov esi,1`
//     with esi live. Assigning to the parameter instead (v0, 48.5%) produced
//     `mov [esp+0x80],1`, a store into the argument slot, and turned the
//     `test` into a `cmp` against the register holding the zero.
//   * Pair_004dacf0 with NO constructors at all: a user-provided default
//     constructor zero-initialises the pair at the top of the function, and
//     the original has no such stores (v0 had three `mov [esp+X],ebp`).
//   * `if (cur == (Class_004dbe10(map->head)))`: the original's head test is
//     `mov ebx,[edi+4] / xor edx,edx / cmp eax,ebx / sete dl / test dl,dl /
//     je`, i.e. the End() iterator is a VALUE compared through operator==.
//     Comparing `cur.ptr == map->head` loads the head straight into the cmp
//     and drops the sete/test (49.7 -> 47.7 when reverted).
// Tried and did NOT work:
//   * declaring `wraps` before `map` to swap the esi/edi roles the original has
//     (map in edi, wraps in esi): no effect at all, 47.7 either way.
//   * the other change folded into the same run as the head test (both
//     together): 47.9, worse than the head test alone, so the two do not
//     compose.
// Still differs:
//   * `need` and `want` are in the opposite callee-saved registers (the
//     original has need in ebx and want in ebp, this file has need in ebp and
//     want in ebx, and therefore the `cmp` is the other way round).
//   * the original stores `need` into the lock's home at 0x28 and compares in
//     registers; this file gives `need` a home of its own, one dword high.
//   * the original keeps `map->count <= wraps` as `cmp [edi+0xc],esi / jbe`
//     and does not fold the known zero; this file folds it to `test eax,eax`.
//   * the trailing half (the two insert calls, VirtualAlloc, the record and
//     its ctor) has not been revisited since v0.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash retry: spelling `if (!size)` as `if (size < 1)` is the
// only change that scored better (52.2 percent, 778 bytes) because MSVC folds
// the `size = 1` fixup into the test (`cmp esi,1`). tools/headers.py (128 sets)
// and a dummy-declaration sweep of N = 0..400 all stay flat at 51.1/51.5, and
// every res/need/want declaration-order permutation keeps lock in ebx and the
// zero from `res = 0` in ebp, so the edi/ebx/ebp rotation above still stands.
// Carve a block out of the reservation allocator: enter the lock, round the
// request up (need) and double it (want), then walk the free-block map for a
// block of at least want bytes, splitting it around the allocation point and
// committing the pages with VirtualAlloc. Same std::map idiom as 0x4db000,
// 0x4db450 and 0x4db1c0: the block is the map's value_type, a base and a length.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash pass 2 (best 55.6 with `#include <memory.h>` added, 55.2
// without; tools/headers.py picks <windows.h> <memory.h> as the closest set and
// the 55.6 state is the same one 28 to 52 unused declarations reach): moved
// `unsigned int res = 0;` from the
// top of the locals down to just after `cur` and spelled the size fixup
// `if (size == 0) size = 1;` (which restores the original's `test esi,esi /
// jne / mov esi,1`; `if (size < 1)` had folded it to `cmp esi,1 / jae` and was
// what the earlier 52.2 version used). Those two moves took lock/map from ebx
// to edi and pushed the code from 52.2 to 55.2 percent.
// What is left is ONE register choice and its cascade: MSVC materialises the
// constant 0 in ebp at the size test (`xor ebp,ebp / cmp esi,ebp`) and then
// reuses ebp for `DAT_005289d4 = 0`, `q.length = 0` and the two zero pushes.
// The original never keeps 0 in a register: it stores the 0s as immediates and
// uses esi (wraps, just zeroed) for `q.length` and the FUN_004dbe10 argument.
// Because ebp is held by that constant here, `want` is pushed out to ebx, and
// with ebx occupied the find path's iterator temporaries land in edx/ecx where
// the original uses ebx and the head test's flag lands in cl where the
// original uses dl. Give ebp to `want` and the whole function should snap into
// place; the original's callee-saved homes are edi = lock then map, esi = size
// then wraps, ebp = want, with ebx left for temporaries and `need` and `res`
// memory only.
// Tried this pass, all scored with check.py --sym:
//   * demoting `res` by reading it once into a separate variable (`blk`,
//     `void* blk`, or a plain copy): 48.0, the compiler coalesces the copy and
//     keeps res in ebp; `res` declared at the very top again (w1): 51.1.
//   * `if (n == 0)`, `if (!size)`, `size = n ? n : 1`: all still materialise
//     the ebp zero (55.2/53.7/55.2).
//   * replacing the loop's `DAT_005289d4 = 0` with `= wraps`, and/or
//     `q.length = wraps`, to remove the constant: 52.2 and worse; the constant
//     still appears.
//   * swapping the need/want declarations, declaring need+want before size,
//     declaring res after wraps, after ins, after b, after cur: 53.7 to 55.2.
//   * a dummy-declaration sweep of N = 0..400 in steps of 4 flips between
//     exactly two states, 55.6 and 46.8, with no intermediate value, so the
//     source shape is the only thing left to change.
//   * defining the real preceding function 0x4dabb0 above this one (the guide's
//     state technique) gives 55.6, the same state as the dummy sweep, so it
//     buys 0.4 points and is not worth the extra code here.
// The zero-register theory to try next: make `res = 0` not a foldable
// constant, or get the size test to emit `test` before any zero exists. Every
// spelling of the fixup tried so far emits the cmp.
