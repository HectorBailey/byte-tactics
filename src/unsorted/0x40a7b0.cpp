// deepseek-v4.1-flash (3857, 2026-10-01): hoisting `Feature* feats = g_game->features` regresses to 74.8% (649 bytes); the `(f->flags & 2) && f->value != 0.0f` swap gives 88.2%. Best stays 88.7%, same ebx/ebp swap.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash retry (3312, 2026-10-01): `feature <= 0xfffa` drops to 88.2%; a `(f->flags & 2) != 0` spelling and hoisted x/y declarations stay at 88.7% with the same ebx/ebp swap.
//
// deepseek-v4.1-flash retry: still 88.7% (645 vs 644 bytes), only the _S/_Q
// register pick in the reallocating push_back differs (original _S in ebx,
// _Q in ebp; ours swapped, so `lea ecx,[ebp+eax*8]` costs one extra byte).
// This pass re-confirmed it is not reachable from this file's source: adding
// <memory>, <xutility>, <algorithm>, <memory.h> or <windows.h> (all 88.7%),
// a named Elem local, field-wise construction, (short) casts, a while/++x
// loop, an ElemVec reference or pointer alias, a `float val` local, a 2-arg
// insert, both static-inline helpers (void AddCell and Elem MakeCell) all
// scored 88.7% or worse. The only remaining difference is the ebx/ebp swap.
// Rebuilds the list of candidate cells: clears the vector at +0x4d, then
// walks every map cell and adds (x, y, feature value) for each cell whose
// feature (index below 0xfffb) has a non-zero value at +0xf0 and bit 1 of
// its flags byte set. 0x40a260 later sorts these by distance.
//
// GPT-6.1-sol retry verification: the saved source still scores 88.7% (645/644 bytes).
// GPT-6.1-sol refinement: two variants scored 67.1% and 88.2%; restored the
// best and verified it again at 88.7%. The `_S`/`_Q` allocation swap remains.
// 2026-09-30 retry check: 88.7% (645/644 bytes); the saved source remains best.
// This pass again isolated the mismatch to `_S`/`_Q` register allocation.
// The _S/_Q register swap remains the only difference; the 128-header sweep and
// prior source-form variants recorded below did not improve it.
// Partial (88.7%, 645 bytes against the original's 644): only one allocator
// decision differs. In the reallocating branch of the inlined push_back
// (vector::insert(_P, 1, _X)) the original keeps the freshly allocated
// buffer (_S) in ebx and the first _Ucopy result (_Q) in ebp; ours swaps
// them. The swap costs the extra byte because _End = _S + _N compiles to
// `lea ecx, [ebx + eax*8]` (3 bytes) in the original but
// `lea ecx, [ebp + eax*8]` (4 bytes: ebp as a base needs a disp8) in ours,
// which shifts every later address by one. Every instruction before
// `mov ebx,eax` (_S, 0x40a8e2) is byte-identical, so the choice is decided
// by the whole function's IR, not by the source order here.
//
// Not changed by: push_back of a temporary or of a named local, an explicit
// insert(end(), 1, X) or insert(end(), X), a static inline helper returning
// the Elem by value, casting the coordinates to short, a float local for the
// value, any of the 128 header sets (tools/headers.py). This is the same
// wall the guide records for out-of-line vector::insert copies (0x408f30 is
// an identical 88.7%): treat it as compiler state and move on. Elem's
// constructor must take the value as a float parameter: that gives the
// original's fld/fstp copy of the feature value (a plain field copy uses mov).
//
// space-bunny-free retry (88.7% again, 645 of 644 bytes, nothing changed): the
// only difference is which of the two dead callee-saved registers takes the
// fresh buffer (_S) and which takes the first _Ucopy result (_Q) in the
// reallocating push_back. Both are free there (the x counter is spilled at
// [esp+0x10], the y counter at [esp+0x18]), and the loop tails, the spills and
// both stack slots are byte-identical, so it is one allocator decision. Not
// reached by tools/headers.py (128 sets, all 88.7%), nor by defining the real
// neighbour 0x40a5d0 of the same class and translation unit in the same file
// ahead of this one (scored in build/scratch/0x40a7b0/v1.cpp: still 88.7%,
// same single hunk). This is the same wall as the out-of-line inserts 0x408f30,
// 0x40d020 and 0x40d290 the guide records: treat it as compiler state.
// deepseek-v4.1 retry (88.7% again, 645 of 644 bytes, code unchanged): the swap
// survived about 100 more variants, including a file-scope padding sweep of
// K = 0..1200 in steps of 16 (all 88.7%, unlike 0x475bd0 where padding flips
// the pick), direct 3-arg insert (47.7%), 2-arg insert, while/for and ++x
// spellings, nested ifs, a reference temp, an array temp, copy-init and
// field-wise construction, ctor parameter reorder, flat fields instead of
// Point16, a spelled-out allocator, moving the <vector> include down, and
// preceding dummy functions that use the same template. The only remaining
// difference is still ebx (_S) vs ebp (_Q).
// deepseek-v4.1-flash retry 2 (88.7% again, 645 of 644 bytes, code unchanged):
// fresh levers all failed to flip the pick. A file-scope sweep of N unused
// `extern int dummyK;` declarations, N = 0..2400 step 4 (two batches plus the
// prior 16-step sweep), is 88.7% everywhere, so the pick is not reachable from
// the compiler's global symbol state. A Feature reference, both condition
// orders, a nested value/flags if, an `unsigned short fi = row[x].feature`
// local, `g_game->features + index` pointer arithmetic, a row pointer declared
// outside the loop, (short) casts, insert(end(), ...), a two-step temp and a
// field-wise temp are all 88.7% or worse. Making `flags` a byte, unsigned short
// (mask 0x200) or unsigned int (mask 0x2000000) changes the emitted test and
// drops to 69%. The single `lea ecx,[ebp+eax*8]` vs `[ebx+eax*8]` byte remains;
// see the notes above, this is the archived compiler-state wall.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash retry 3 (2026-10-01): the 0x408f30 "hand-written
// namespace std vector clone" lever is dead here too. A full clone of the
// class template (from <climits> + <memory> + <xutility>, no <vector>) gives
// byte-identical 88.7% (645/644) with the same ebx/ebp swap, so the pick is
// not header state. Also no effect: bool, int and char locals for the
// two-condition test, a flags-byte local (89.4%, 646 bytes, a different diff),
// address-taking every vector member through a derived class, prepending
// <iostream>, <string>, <map>, <list>, <algorithm>, <memory>, <set> or
// <deque>, and 1..64 dead __inline helper call sites (the /Ob2 budget does
// move the code, but never to a flipped pick).
// space-bunny-free pass 2026-10-02. The shipped file is unchanged at 88.7%
// (645 of 644 bytes) and the _S/_Q pick is the only difference. What is new here
// is a MATCHed twin, a byte-faithful platform for testing insert's source, and
// two negative results that close off whole families for the next pass.
//
// THE MATCHED TWIN: 0x40a260 (MATCH, 834/834) is the other method of this same
// class and uses this same std::vector<Elem_0040cc40>, and its inlined
// reserve() has the identical tail: _End = _S + _N / _Last = _S + size() /
// _First = _S. It puts _S in **ebp** there, not ebx. So the pick is not a fixed
// preference for one of the two dead callee-saved registers: in 0x40a260 esi,
// edi and ebx are the type, list and range parameters, which outrank the local
// _S, and _S takes what is left. Here esi is the vector pointer and edi is
// insert's _P, so _S and _Q split ebx and ebp between them, and the original
// gives the better one to _S. The pick therefore depends on the competition,
// and _S is not pinned to ebp: see the derived-class note below, where it lands
// in edi.
//
// THE PLATFORM (the useful lead). Nothing outside <vector>'s insert can change
// how many times _S or _Q is referenced, so to test insert itself I replaced
// <vector> with the primary template written out in namespace std (VC5 rejects
// an explicit specialization of a class template, error C2989, so the
// 0x408f30 "clone trick" is the only route). _Destroy, size and capacity must be
// **defined** in the clone, because the original inlines them at some call sites
// (erase's _Destroy vanishes, two of the three size() calls in insert are
// inlined); _Ucopy and _Ufill must be **declared and never defined**, which is
// what keeps them calls to 0x40cc40 and 0x40d5b0. That clone is byte-faithful:
// 645 bytes, 88.69%, the identical single lea hunk. It is in
// build/scratch/0x40a7b0/gen5.py (k00_faithful). A derived class is NOT a
// usable platform: with only one caller in the translation unit /Ob2 inlines the
// first _Ucopy and the function grows to 665 bytes (61.3%). Forcing the vector's
// members out of line by taking their addresses is byte-neutral on its own
// (645 / 88.69%, j00) and does not stop that inlining, though it is what the
// original file must have done: 0x40c5b0, 0x40ca30, 0x40ca50, 0x40cc30, 0x40cc40
// and 0x40d5b0 all exist in the exe for this element type.
//
// NEGATIVE RESULT 1, and it retires a guide rule here: a reference to _S that
// folds away never reaches the register allocator, so the pick is not a
// reference-count tie the source can reach. On the clone, `_S = _S;`,
// `_End = _S + (_N + (_S - _S));` and `_First = _S + (_S - _S);` are all
// **byte-identical** to the control, so the allocator never sees the extra
// reference; the ones that do not fold (a second _Ucopy, _S inside _Last's sum,
// _S + _S in _First) all grow the function to 656 to 659 bytes. So the guide's
// "the original may have used the other variable once more in a way that folds
// away" cannot explain this residual, and no amount of folding will.
//
// NEGATIVE RESULT 2: 25 further perturbations inside the faithful clone all
// leave lea_regs at ebp/ebp, that is, `_S` in ebp: the six orders of the three
// tail statements and their groupings, `_End = _N + _S`, `const iterator _S`,
// `_Q` and `_S` declared then assigned, a `_D` destination local for
// `_Q + _M`, `&_Q[_M]`, `(size_type)_M`, the expanded `_M < size() ? size() +
// size() : size() + _M`, and swapping the two independent statements `_Ufill(_Q,
// _M, _X)` and `_Ucopy(_P, _Last, _Q + _M)` (83.3%). Declaration order in the
// caller was swept too (w, y, x and row at function scope in four orders, row
// declared inside the for, w inside the outer loop) and is inert here, like most
// of the tree. Nothing reaches the pick.
//
// NOT REACHED, with scores: an explicit insert(end(), 1, X) is 696 bytes and
// 47.7%; _N expanded as a ternary of two sums is 663 / 76.9%; the derived-class
// insert is 665 / 61.3% with _S in edi (which is how we know it is movable at
// all); a named Elem local, a float value local, nested ifs, walking the row
// with a pointer, an unsigned short feature local, <windows.h> first, an
// explicit std::vector<Elem, std::allocator<Elem> > typedef, and member
// pointers to size, capacity and both insert overloads are all 88.7% or worse.
//
// PERMUTER, and the file is restored: 16 minutes, 8564 candidates. The log says
// "88.7% -> 88.7% (score 252 -> 252)" and best.json records best_ratio 0.8869
// against top_ratio 0.9050, so the wrong candidate is reported twice, as the
// brief says. Scored by hand: best.cpp is 645 bytes / 88.69% (no gain), and
// **best_ratio.cpp is 644 bytes / 90.5%, which is rejected.** Read the bytes: it
// hoists `xor ebx, ebx` above the call to FUN_00481550 and passes the literal 0
// as `push ebx` where the original has `push 0` (0x40a808), drops the x
// counter's home store `mov dword ptr [esp + 0x10], ebx` (0x40a813), and adds a
// redundant second store of y, `mov dword ptr [esp + 0x18], ebx`, which the
// original does not have (it stores y once, at 0x40a7fd). Same instruction
// count, same 644 bytes, but it trades a difference that was only a jump target
// for a real codegen difference, and it leaves the _S/_Q residual untouched, so
// it can never reach MATCH. Its source (`int y = 0;` before the loop, `int x =
// 0;` in the body) reads well, so the score is not the reason to reject it: the
// bytes are.
//
// WHAT STILL DIFFERS: one thing. `lea ecx, [ebx + eax*8]` (3 bytes) at 0x40a92e
// where we emit `lea ecx, [ebp + eax*8]` (4 bytes), because _S is in ebp and ebp
// as a base needs a disp8; every later address shifts by one. 15 of the diff
// lines are internal jump targets that moved; ignoring those this is 95.5%.
//
// DeepSeek V4.1 Flash retry 4 (2026-10-02): a fresh 3-minute permuter run
// produced no gain (best.cpp byte-identical to this file). The 644-byte
// best_ratio candidate is the same prologue-shape trade already rejected above:
// it carries the identical ebx/ebp residual PLUS real codegen differences, so
// ignoring moved jump targets it is 94.1% against this file's 95.5%, and it is
// not adopted. Fresh source levers all failed to flip the pick: an inline
// wrapper around FUN_00481550 taking the y handle (byte-identical, so the extra
// use folds), a feature-value inline helper, a static AddCell push_back helper,
// a do-while with a pre-declared feature pointer, ctor init-list and member
// assignment orders, dropping the copy ctor or operator<, and feature pointer
// arithmetic instead of indexing. Rebuilding the insert clone was not pursued:
// the archived faithful clone already reproduces the same 88.7% wall. Still one
// byte: the lea base in the reallocating push_back (_S wants ebx, gets ebp).
