// Claude Opus 5.5 (#5122): still 99.5%, but the MECHANISM of the walk1 reload
// order is now known (gdb traces of C2, see tools/c2prio.py):
//  * The two reloads after walk1's fill loop come from live-range splits
//    (FUN_00439385). When walk1's ebp temporary is coloured (step 12 of the
//    trace), C2 splits pts's piece and the `i - 1` temporary (spilled at
//    [esp+0x24]) in increasing candidate id order, and the reload of the one
//    split later is emitted first. Ours: temp #49 then pts piece #57, so pts
//    is reloaded first. The original needs pts's piece split first.
//  * pts's piece gets its id at step 11 (walk2's ebp temporary), from a LIFO
//    of freed ids [4, 58, 57, 26, ...]: the pieces made before it there are
//    c0 #3's and count's, so pts gets the third id, 57. A fourth would be 26,
//    below the temp's 49, which flips the order. Verified: deleting the first
//    scan's `if (count > 0)` guard makes count split into two pieces, pts
//    gets 26 and walk1's reloads come out in the original's order (the guard
//    is then missing, so it is a diagnostic, not a fix). 0x4c1000's two walks
//    obey the same rule.
//  * So the original most likely had one more piece before pts at step 11
//    (count or a zero constant split into two regions) or one fewer freed id
//    on top of that list. Not found: first-scan forms (for, while, goto and
//    else guards, indexed points, pre-increment latch, initialised i), the
//    0x4c1000 walk shape (no `b`, function-scope `j`: 99.5% with the same
//    hunk), function-scope i/j combinations, explicit `a = &pts[i]` pointers,
//    parameter copies (coalesced back into the parameter) and address
//    spellings in the walk head.
//
// GPT-6 retry (#4916): current checkall.py confirms 99.5% at 613 bytes, with
// the documented walk1 latch reload order as the only code difference.
// GPT-6 retry (#5226): rechecked at 99.5%; the latch still reloads pts before i.
// #5277 Codex retry: re-confirmed the walk1 latch reload order. Moving the
// first scan's count guard to an early return scored 86.7%, so the saved
// 99.5% version remains best.
// DeepSeek V4.1 Flash (this session, 99.5, 613 of 613, same single hunk): ran the permuter for
// 3 minutes (2854 candidates, flat) and then about 50 hand variants scored directly from
// build/scratch/0x4c0820/variants*.py, all at 99.5 with the byte-identical hunk (walk1 latch
// reloads pts then i; original i then pts) unless noted. Tried and rejected this session:
// single-statement wrap `j = count - 1` / `i = count - 1`, `i -= 1`, combined `if (--i < 0)`,
// reversed test `iymax != i` (99.0), function-scope j (walk1 only and both walks), function-scope
// i (walk1 only and both), function-scope i plus j, `out = spans` after `i = iymin`, `scanorder`
// (`y = ymin` before `s = spans`), xdx declaration split/reorder/move, an extra `int j`, extra dead
// function-scope locals (plain and initialised), `int iymax, iymin`, `register int i`, y0
// pre-declared then assigned, the 0x4c0c70 `for (;;) { ... i = i - 1; if (i == iymax) break; }`
// latch (single and double wrap, compile to our bytes), a function-scope `q = pts` base alias, and
// the tail reorder `wrapaftery0` (76.2). Also re-confirmed: `i = j` latch (70.0), block-local
// p/q for the two edge points (70.1), `for` fill (93.4), y0 before j (67.5), b before y0 (70.1),
// latch as if/else, walk2 j/y0/b/out permutations. Since the 0x4c0330 and 0x4c0c70 matched siblings
// both emit points-before-index, our compile follows the family norm and 0x4c0820's original is the
// outlier, so this is an allocator tie-break with no source-shape lever found. Only the walk1 head's
// i register or the global live-range creation order could still flip it; every lever inside walk1
// and every declaration/scope permutation tried is inert.
// space-bunny-free session 2 (50 min timebox, harness first): still 99.5, 613 of 613 bytes, the same
// single hunk. NEW RESULT, now measured rather than guessed: the order of the two live-out reloads
// at the walk1 latch is NOT reachable by any spelling inside walk1. I built the standalone harness
// build/scratch/4c0820/h_scan1.cpp (first scan plus walk1 only, 4 params) which reproduces the
// pattern exactly (fill exit: pts into ebx, then the i-1 CSE temp into edi) and swept it with
// build/scratch/4c0820/sweep2.py: 1960 combinations of 5 ways to wrap j, 7 head statement orders,
// 7 latch spellings, 4 loop forms (do/while, for(;;)+break, for(;;)+continue/break, top test),
// b at function or block scope, and 2 fill forms. Not one emits `mov edi,[tmp]` before
// `mov ebx,[pts]` with that same register pair. The only shapes that put a load into edi first do
// it by moving pts itself into edi (head order `b = &pts[j]` first, or `int j = i < 0 ? count : i;
// j--;` with a continue/break latch), which changes the head bytes, so that is a false lead.
// Also inert at 99.5/613 on the whole function this session: the latch as if/else (`if (i > 0)
// i--; else {i = count; i--;}`, and `if (i - 1 < 0) {...} else {i = i - 1;}`), both walks in
// else form, the guard as `if (!(y0 >= y1))`, the test as `while (!(i == iymax))`, walk1 as
// `for(;;)` with continue/break, the last scan as a for loop, and the last two together. Note for
// the next attempt: register number (ebx 3 vs edi 7), slot address ([esp+8] vs [esp+0x24]) and
// creation order (parameter before the head's CSE temp) all give the SAME answer for our code and
// for the original, so none of those three can be the rule, and the fill block's own kill order
// (edi at `h = y1 - y0`, ebx at `x = (x<<16)+0xffff`) is identical in both. The only remaining
// free variable is the insertion order into the block's live list, which no source shape tried so
// far reaches; try a lever OUTSIDE walk1 that reorders the whole function's live-range creation.
// space-bunny-free session (50 min): still 99.5, 613 of 613 bytes, the same single hunk (the walk1
// latch reloads pts then the index, the original reloads the index then pts). What this session
// added, all screened on the /Fa listing and all inert (identical latch order, mostly identical
// bytes): the value in [esp+0x24] is an UNNAMED compiler temp, the CSE of the walk head's `i - 1`
// with the latch's, never a source local, so no spelling of `j` can move it (a function-scope `j`
// in walk1 only, or in both walks, compiles to the same 339-line listing, frame included); the
// frame leaves 16 free bytes below the first live slot (0x0-0xc), and moving all four fill
// temporaries (h, y, dy, rows) to function scope fits in them, frame still 0x14024 and every other
// byte unchanged, so slot numbering is not the discriminator either; dead function-scope locals
// (one to three, plain, initialised) and dead block-locals in the walk head, the fill and the
// first scan change nothing, so neither is the lclvar count; const-ness of the parameters and of
// the Point fields, and a `const Point* const cp = pts` view for the reads, change nothing; the
// fill loop as for(;rows;--rows), while(rows){...rows--;}, do/while(rows-- > 0), out = out + 1, or
// out++ first, changes nothing; a forward `goto` for the failing `y0 < y1` test (walk1 alone, both
// walks, and spelled `!(y0 < y1)`) leaves the same graph and the same order, and neither does
// swapping the loop test's operands (`while (iymax != i)`, `while (!(i == iymax))`) or the
// pre-decrement spelling `i -= 1`. Rejected with a
// full score: dropping the `b` local and indexing `pts[j]` directly, the 0x4c1000 shape, is 93.6%
// at the same 613 bytes, so the function-scope `b` is what holds slot 0x20 in both walks here;
// `int rows = y1 - y0` and `int h = b->y - y0` (either re-read the original does not make) turn the
// walk head into the pointer-walking form; folding `b = &pts[j]` into the y1 read, or reading y1
// straight off the array, changes the head. tools/permute.py (12 min budget, 8913 candidates, seed
// 11) and tools/headers.py (128 sets) are both flat at 99.5. Best next lead: the order is chosen
// inside one block's exit code and MSVC emits walk2's equivalent pair the other way round in
// 0x4c1000, so it is not a function-wide counter; find a source shape that changes the block graph
// AT the latch (the predecessor set of the latch, or whether the fill's exit and the latch are one
// block) without changing the emitted bytes, which is the only lever every sweep so far has missed.
// DeepSeek V4.1 Flash session (45 min): still 99.5, 613 of 613 bytes, the same single hunk (walk1
// latch loads pts then i; original loads i then pts). Re-confirmed nothing in the header state:
// tools/headers.py --cpp (768 sets) is flat at 99.5. Swept and rejected this session, all 99.5 with
// the identical hunk unless noted: all 24 first-scan comparison orders (only the current ABCD
// scores 99.5), all 120 inner-loop statement orders (the current ABCDE is one of four that keep the
// bytes; the rest move the loop's adds, none flips the latch), top-tested while/for latches (66.7),
// goto-test latch, for(;;)/while(1) break latches, ~30 exotic wrap spellings (comma, inner while,
// switch, ternary, eq-zero, if-else, do-while(0), double if, parenthesised count-1, inline
// WrapDown helper, macros), long/short/unsigned/register types for count/color/i/iymin/x and for
// the body locals, pointer arithmetic and &spans[0] and cast spellings, decl-then-assign forms for
// every body local, guard spellings, initialization placement/order, struct definition order,
// dead copy-through-temp probes on pts/i/out/b, 7000 random 1-to-5 combinations of two 38-mutation
// sets, and prepending the matched sibling sources 0x4c0330/0x4c0c70/0x4c1000 above this function.
// A 613-byte reduced copy of the function (walk1 plus first scan only) reproduces the same swap, so
// the cause is inside walk1.
// NEW EVIDENCE (this session): the exe scan in build/scratch/0x4c0820/scan_latch.py shows the sibling
// 0x4c1000 has a walk1 with the SAME shape and instruction order (jne, then the two latch loads,
// then the wrap) but loads pts before i, while 0x4c1000's walk2 loads i before pts. So the order is
// not a walk1 source-shape lever at all: it is a whole-function allocation tie-break that flips
// between functions with identical walk shapes. The register assignments are the same in both
// (pts in ebx, index in edi/esi), so register order is not the discriminator either. Best next
// lead: a change far from walk1 that perturbs the global allocation order (the pcode/live-range
// creation order), or a compiler state change; source-shape edits inside walk1 have been exhausted.
// 30-min checkpoint (deepseek-v4.1-flash, this session): 99.5 percent, 613 of 613 bytes, ONE hunk
// left. THE LEVER FOUND THIS SESSION: the 4th parameter is `int color`, not `unsigned char`.
// Changing it fixes the final call register pick outright (the whole final scan then holds color
// in ebx and surf in ebp exactly as the original). Every earlier session had `unsigned char`
// there, which is why the ebx/ebp pick looked unreachable. The caller (0x458fa0) also declares
// the 4th argument `int param_4`. With that fix only the walk1 latch order remains: original
// loads i from [esp+0x24] then pts from [esp+0x1403c]; ours loads pts first then i.
// Tried this session, all 99.5 / same single hunk: header sweep (128 sets), N unused extern int
// (0..128), 300 declaration-order permutations, predec/minus-eq/plus-count/ternary/if-else/
// eq-minus-1/`i += count` latch spellings, for(;;)+break and while(1) latches, y1-before-y0,
// explicit block-local pa/q pointers, function-scope j, raw-j-plus-wrapped-k, sibling 0x4c0c70
// walk style (50 percent), dead-statement probes, callee prototype type changes, dummy
// struct/function/typedef/class prefixes (0..200 each), struct-as-class and long-field variants,
// walk2 head/inner-loop probes (the compiler normalises walk2's out/i order), first-loop shape
// probes, function-scope j, and function-scope i for both walks (99.5, same hunk). The two
// siblings 0x4c0330 and 0x4c0c70 (matched) both reload the points base BEFORE the index in their
// latch, so our compile follows the family norm and the original's order is the odd one.
// Best next lead: the order is the allocator's emission order inside one block, so look for a
// source or type change that makes the i load be emitted before the live-out pts reload, the way
// a source statement naturally precedes a live-out spill. The `int color` discovery suggests the
// allocator state responds to parameter/type changes rather than statement shapes.
//
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (#3807): 94.1 -> 98.0 percent, 613 of 613 bytes. The edge walks now hold the
// second point in a function-scope pointer b (b = &pts[j], every field read through b) while y0/y1
// became block-local to each walk. That pair is the lever the earlier sessions could not find: it
// lands y0 at 0x28 in walk1 and 0x24 in walk2 with b at 0x20 in both, exactly the original, and the
// frame stays 0x14024. The function-scope `int y0, y1;` was replaced by `Point_004c0820* b;`.
// Still different (both allocator picks): the walk1 tail loads pts from [esp+0x1403c] one instruction
// before reloading i from [esp+0x24] (original: i then pts), and the final call holds surf in ebx and
// color in ebp (original: color in ebx, surf in ebp, pushed in the same order either way).
// Re-tested here: reading y1 before y0 (both walks) is 60.7 percent / 609 bytes, a for-loop final
// scan is byte-identical at 98.0, and hoisting surf into a local fails to compile as edited.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (#3940): local copies of the call arguments inside the if (c = color; sf = surf;)
// are dead-code eliminated and leave the diff byte-identical at 98.0 / 613, so the surf/color ebx/ebp
// pick is not reachable through the copy-to-locals trick. Swapping walk1's out/i statement order fixes
// the tail hunk but re-allocates the whole walk (86.2 percent / 614 bytes). Both reverted.
//
// PARTIAL 94.1%, 613 of 613 bytes. The two edge walks read pts[i]/pts[j] fields directly
// instead of caching &pts[i]/&pts[j] in pointer locals, share y0/y1/x/dx at function scope, and the
// first walk assigns out = spans before i = iymin (the second keeps the opposite order). Those three
// shape fixes took 60.7 to 78.3 to 89.2 to 94.1. Remaining differences, all allocator picks: the
// walk-local y0 and the internal &pts[j] spill swap slots 0x20/0x28 (0x20/0x24 in walk2), the walk1
// tail loads pts before reloading i, and the final call puts surf in ebx and color in ebp instead of
// color in ebx and surf in ebp. Ruled out in earlier sessions (scores): declaration-order sweeps of
// y0/y1/x/dx/rows/iymin/iymax (94.1 unchanged), block-local y0 (92.1), explicit b = &pts[j] (60.7),
// shared dy/rows/y/h (94.1 unchanged), separate scan index (43.1), scan index before the guard
// (42.9), extern dummy TU-state prefix at N=1/2/8 (60.7 in the 78.3 shape).
//
// Second pass (space-bunny-free), all free --sym scores, none beat 94.1:
// * Declaration order is NOT the lever here: splitting `int iymin, iymax;` into two statements,
//   merging `int y0,y1; int x,dx;` into one, and moving that pair after the initialised bounds
//   each leave the score and the diff set bit for bit at 94.1.
// * tools/headers.py, 128 sets: every set is 94.1%, so this is not header state.
// * Block-local `Point_004c0820* bj = &pts[j]` in each walk (94.1, identical diff: MSVC still
//   emits one CSE temp) and a shared function-scope named `bj` (90.1) do not move the walk slots.
// * Block-local y0 (92.1) and block-local y0+y1 (92.1) rotate the walk slots but ALSO swap the
//   iymin/iymax pair 0x30/0x2c, which is a net loss. Adding any one function-scope local does
//   the same flip, so the frame packing is a parity-like function of how many function-scope
//   locals there are: keep the count as it is.
// * Dropping the two extra braces around the walk blocks (so the walk index is the function-scope
//   i instead of a shadowing one) shrinks the frame by 4 bytes (609) and drops to 63.7%.
// * Naming the &pts[j] temp at its first use INSIDE `if (y0 < y1)` instead of letting MSVC CSE
//   it across the branch drops to 36.1% with a 604-byte frame: the original's lea and its spill
//   are both emitted BEFORE the `jge`, so that value is live into the branch. Keep the field
//   reads written as `b->x` / `b->z` / `b->y` and let MSVC CSE them.
//
// deepseek-v4.1-flash retry (#3217): re-confirmed 94.1 and the whole 92.1 block-local family. A
// function-scope named pointer for the second edge point (bp = &pts[j] used in both walks) drops to
// 60.7 (609 bytes) because it gives the pts base edi instead of ebx. Block-local y0 with the
// function-scope y0 removed, or with it kept dead, is 92.1 either way; removing the unused `int ay;`
// and swapping the iymin/iymax declaration order in that shape are inert (92.1), so the iymin/iymax
// flip is not a declaration or dead-local parity lever. `--i; i = count - 1;` for the walk1 tail is
// byte-identical to `i = i - 1; i = count; i--;` at 94.1.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (#3585): re-ran the block-local y0/y1 family (both walks, walk1 only,
// walk2 only, walk2 declaring y0/y1 before j, plus one extra function-scope local as a
// parity probe): all land on 92.1 with the same 34-line diff. Every block-local y0 shape
// fixes walk1's slots (ptr 0x20, j 0x24, y0 0x28) but rotates walk2's and flips iymin/iymax
// to 0x2c/0x30, so one function-scope y0 (this shape) stays the best at 94.1.
// The walk diff is a pure two-way swap, not a rotation: with idx already right in both walks,
// original is (ptr 0x20, idx 0x24, y0 0x28) and (ptr 0x20, y0 0x24, idx 0x28), ours is
// (y0 0x20, idx 0x24, ptr 0x28) and (y0 0x20, ptr 0x24, idx 0x28). The original's &pts[j] keeps
// 0x20 in BOTH walks while y0 changes slot between them, so the next thing to try is a shape that
// makes the &pts[j] value a single variable spanning both walks while y0 is not: the opposite of
// the block-local y0 that was just ruled out. The final ebx/ebp pair (color, surf) is independent:
// it is the reverse of the push order, so it is the register preference for the two argument
// temporaries, and a local copy of each (94.1) does not change it.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (#3889), still 98.0 percent, 613 of 613 bytes: splitting walk1's wrap into
// a raw `int j = i - 1;` plus a wrapped `int k = j;` used for b = &pts[k] and ending the walk with
// `i = j;` (the shape the original's 0x4c0949 reload of [esp+0x24] suggests) regresses to 96.6
// percent at the same 613 bytes, so the two remaining hunks stay as noted: the walk1 tail loads pts
// (ebx) one instruction before reloading the index (original: index then pts) and the final call
// holds surf in ebx / color in ebp (original: color in ebx / surf in ebp).
