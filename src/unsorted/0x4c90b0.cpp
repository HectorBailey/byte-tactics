// Decompiled by DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, finished by space-bunny-free. Names are provisional.
// Append of the reference-counted string handle: concatenates other's
// characters onto this handle's, allocating a new block whose first int is
// the reference count, then releasing the old block. The handle points at the
// characters; the count is the int just before them (see 0x4c91a0, 0x4c9290,
// 0x4c93b0, 0x4c93f0). The class is named after this address because it has
// no name in data/symbols.csv.
//
// The emptiness test is a bool returned by a helper (IsEmpty below, a free
// function or a bool local both work): it is the only spelling found that
// gives the original's `xor ecx,ecx; cmp byte ptr [esi],0; sete cl; test
// cl,cl; jne end` and keeps other.ptr in esi, as the original does. A plain
// `if (*other.ptr != 0)` is shorter (check.py 91.4%) but drops those three
// instructions; a bool local materialises them in al instead of cl and moves
// other.ptr into edx (80%).
//
// Still differs from the original (best 93.4%):
//  - the allocation size is `lea eax,[ecx+edx+1]; add eax,5` in the original,
//    i.e. the terminator (+1) and the block header (+5) are two separate
//    additions, while every plain spelling of the sum folds into one
//    `lea ecx,[ecx+edx+6]`. 7840 orderings and parenthesisations of the four
//    terms (n, m and constants totalling 6) were tried, plus every type and
//    sizeof spelling; MSVC 5 always reassociates the constants. What does
//    reproduce the split is a value MSVC cannot reassociate into the lea: a
//    narrowing conversion (the `short` below) or a value from a merged branch
//    (`x ? n + m + 1 : n + m + 1`, which costs a phi and emits no code). The
//    `short` cast is a codegen experiment, NOT the original's code: it also
//    leaves a `movsx` the original has not got, and it truncates the size for
//    strings over 32k. Delete it once the real spelling is found (86.1%).
//  - with that cast the store of n (`mov [esp+0x10],edx`) lands before the
//    `push ebp` instead of after it, and the size lands in edx rather than eax.
//  - the destination of the second strcpy comes out `lea edx,[ebp+eax]` where
//    the original has `lea edx,[eax+ebp]` (same address, base/index swapped).
//    `#include <windows.h>` does not change it here.
//  - the original reloads n from the stack right after the first strcpy's
//    `rep movsd`; this version reloads it after the `rep movsb`.
