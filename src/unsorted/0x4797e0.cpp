// Decompiled by deepseek-v4.1, finished by deepseek-v4.1-flash, finished by GPT-6.1-sol, finished by mimo-v2.6-pro, finished by Space Bunny Free. Names are provisional.
// #4627 Codex retry: re-confirmed 84.6%; the same register-allocation and
// scheduling differences remain after the released direct-global probes.
// SPACE-BUNNY-FREE pass (issue #4476). STATUS: 84.6% (1029 of 1034 bytes), no
// MATCH, and no regression: the file was already at 84.6% when this pass
// started (the 74.1% in my brief is stale, the notes below record the climb).
// About 80 scratch variants were scored with `check.py --sym` on copies in
// build/scratch/0x4797e0/; nothing beat the file as it stands, and the residue
// is still the one allocator coin-flip the earlier passes named. What is new
// here is the mechanism, the negative results that pin it down, and a census of
// how the rest of the exe gets the same reload.
//
// WHAT STILL DIFFERS (instruction-stream diff, five items; the whole 5-byte
// size deficit is item 1's 12 bytes less the 7 bytes items 2 and 3 spend):
//  1. Two `mov ebp, [g_game]` re-materialisations the original has at 0x47988e
//     and 0x4798ed, one after each of the two FUN_004a0bf0 calls in the
//     switch. They are 6 bytes each and are the whole size deficit (1029 vs
//     1034, so the rest of the function is 1 byte over once they are added).
//  2. At the tail test the original keeps `g_game->players` in ecx with no
//     spill; ours puts it in edx and spills it to [esp+0x14], and re-reads
//     g_game and players for the myColour load, so the duplicate-colour block
//     starts with three extra movs.
//  3. In the inlined FreeColour the original spills `entries` to [esp+0x14]
//     and re-reads numPlayers and players out of ebp; ours keeps entries in
//     ebp (reusing the register the `game` local has just vacated), keeps
//     numPlayers in the caller's ecx and walks players out of the [esp+0x14]
//     slot.
//  4. FreeColour's exit test: the original has `cmp ecx,edx; je`, ours has
//     `xor edx,edx; cmp eax,ecx; sete dl; test dl,dl; jne`.
//  5. Twelve bytes of tail padding.
//
// WHY ITEM 1 IS UNREACHABLE FROM ANY SPELLING TRIED (the mechanism, finally
// pinned down). The reload is a re-materialisation of a *temporary* built from
// a direct read of the global: MSVC keeps such a temp in a callee-saved
// register and re-loads it after a call instead of keeping a copy across one.
// It only does that when nothing else wants the register. Two facts fix the
// sides of the trade:
//  * A named local (`Game* game = g_game`) always wins the callee-saved
//    register, because locals are allocated before temporaries, and a local
//    survives a call in a callee-saved register, so it is never re-loaded.
//    That is why the file as it stands has ebp = the local and no reload.
//  * With the local gone (every site spelled `g_game->`) the g_game temporary
//    gets no register home at all: every use re-reads the global, ebp goes to
//    the scaled index (24*playerIndex) and the frame grows to 0x8c. Measured
//    again this pass at 1013 bytes / 43.9%, in five spellings (a blanket
//    rewrite, one with the helpers reading the global themselves, one with
//    named `players`/`np` locals, one in the 0x466dc0 inline-helper idiom,
//    and one with the current player behind a named pointer). Note the
//    arithmetic: even with both reloads the all-global spelling would be 1025
//    bytes, still 9 short of 1034, so the original is NOT the all-global
//    spelling either. It is the local spelling plus two re-materialisations,
//    and no spelling produces that combination.
//
// CENSUS OF THE RELOAD IN THE EXE (build/scratch/0x4797e0/findreload2.sh):
// `mov e(bx|bp|si|di), [0x511de8]` immediately after a `call` occurs 87 times
// in 50 functions. The two MATCHed ones, both in this module, are written with
// plain `g_game->` and no game local at all: 0x47a760, whose
// `mov edi, [0x511de8]` at 0x47a823 sits right after `call 0x464290`, and
// 0x47a0e0, which re-reads the global at nearly every use. So the idiom is
// real, and this function is the one place in the area where the
// 24*playerIndex temporary outranks the g_game temporary.
//
// ITEM 4 IS LOAD-BEARING, WHICH IS WHY THE FILE KEEPS THE `bool done`.
// Every spelling of FreeColour's exit test that emits the original's
// `cmp/je` collapses the whole function's allocation, whatever else is done
// around it: g_game falls out of ebp, 24*playerIndex takes ebp, the frame
// becomes 0x8c and the score drops to 72-74%. Measured this pass: bare
// `if (k == N) return n;` 73.2, `if (!(k != N))` 73.2, `if (!(k < N))` 73.2,
// the `for (n=0;n<10;n++)` + `if (k == N) return n;` shape copied from the
// MATCHed 0x4795e0 72.7 (and it is the closest any variant came on size,
// 1031 bytes), `int left = N - k; if (0 == left)` 74.0, and bare-test-plus-
// extra-named-locals 73.2 twice. Combining the bare test with the caller /
// helper CSE broken by a named `np`, a named `ps`, both, or a named holder
// gives 62.7, 73.2, 62.7, 73.2, so the collapse is not about which single
// value is missing either. Only the `sete` form keeps 84.6. The original has
// no `sete` anywhere, so its pressure comes from item 1, which is the same
// wall seen from the other side.
//
// THE NEAR-COPIES IN THIS MODULE, all MATCHed, all checked again this pass
// (0x4794d0, 0x479500, 0x479530, 0x479560, 0x479590, 0x4795e0, 0x479620,
// 0x479660, 0x479760, 0x479c50, 0x47a0e0, 0x47a700, 0x47a760, 0x47acd0,
// 0x47b9f0; only 0x47ae60 is short at 88.2%):
//  * 0x4795e0 IS FreeColour: `for (owner = 0; owner < 10; owner++) { int i;
//    for (i = 0; i < g_game->itemCount; i++) if (g_game->items[i].owner ==
//    owner) break; if (i == g_game->itemCount) return owner; } return -1;`
//    Adopting it here is what fcsib above is, and it loses 12 points.
//  * 0x47acd0 is the duplicate-colour test: an inline `color_taken(me)`
//    holding the whole loop, with `g_game->table->players[me].color` read
//    inline in the condition and no myColour local. The in-loop read of the
//    player's own colour is what the original does at 0x479a09, but writing
//    it that way here scores 72.4%.
//  * 0x479660 is the gadget-refresh tail (`entries` local, `index != -1`,
//    `gadget = &entries[index]`, `if (gadget != 0)`), which this file already
//    reproduces through its permuter `do {} while (0)` blocks.
//  * 0x47a760 shows the module's `goto`-shaped search and its own g_game
//    reload; 0x466dc0 (99.6%) shows the inline-helper idiom this module uses
//    for repeated menu writes.
//
// TRIED THIS PASS, ALL SCORED, NONE BETTER THAN 84.6% (full variant list and
// the harness that produced them are in build/scratch/0x4797e0/, b1 to b20):
//  * else-branch shapes: the duplicate-colour condition in the
//    `A && B && C` form that reproduces the original's branch targets exactly
//    (four spellings, 84.3), nested `if`s (84.3), `for` and `while` loops
//    (83.7, 84.0), the myColour read inside the loop body (72.4), through a
//    named `players` local (84.6), as a second pointer local read after the
//    FreeColour call (84.6), the sibling's find-a-free loop (72.5-72.7).
//  * FreeColour shapes: the sibling's `for` + bare test (72.7), the bare test
//    with named `np`/`ps` locals (73.2), extra named locals with the `sete`
//    test (84.6, byte-identical), a `for` inner loop (84.6), the helper taking
//    (players, numPlayers) instead of the game (84.6), the helper taking
//    `g_game` (52.1), the helper reading the global itself (52.1), the helper
//    reading through its own named `ps` local (73.2).
//  * breaking the caller/helper CSE so the FreeColour re-reads players and
//    numPlayers out of ebp, which is what the original does: passing `g_game`,
//    passing `g_game` with the store and the entries read also global, and
//    both together: 52.1, 58.1, 39.0. All three grow the frame to 0x8c.
//  * forcing the tail test to be a fresh global read (which is the only way
//    to get item 1): `g_game->players[playerIndex].controller` 68.2, the same
//    with the helper taking `g_game` 41.8, the local dying at the switch so
//    ebp is free for the fresh read 43.9, a second named `game2` copy
//    67.0/43.9, `game = g_game;` after the switch 57.3, at the top of the else
//    72.8.
//  * declaration moves: `entries`, `myColor`, `idx`, `e` into inner blocks,
//    the two buffers swapped, all locals after the buffers: every one
//    byte-identical at 84.6%.
//  * the current player behind a named pointer, an `int*` offset form, and a
//    countdown loop in case 2: 42.3, 43.9, 84.6 (the case-2 countdown the
//    compiler already produces is already the original's shape).
// tools/permute.py ran 15.0 minutes on this file from the 84.6% start: 1994
// candidates, 32 that did not compile, 18 duplicates, 84.6% -> 84.6% (score
// 1626 -> 1626), so it confirms the local optimum once more.
// Follow-up pass (issue #4344, after PR 4474 merged): tools/permute.py's
// best_ratio.cpp scores 84.6 (1029 of 1034) against this file's 84.0, and the
// permuter's own log reported no gain, so best_ratio.cpp must be scored by hand
// with `check.py <addr> <file> --sym` rather than trusted. Tidied on adoption:
// tmp1 -> done, inl0 -> CurMenu, inl1 -> IsPlayerColor, no self-assignments and
// no uninitialised locals; every rename re-checked at 84.6. Still differs: the
// kind-0/kind-1 callee-saved and slot assignment (one EBP allocator coin-flip).
// STATUS (deepseek-v4.1-flash, issue #4344): best is 84.0% (1028 of 1034
// bytes), no MATCH. The previous notes below are superseded where they say
// 74.1%: this file now starts from an 84.0% shape that is a firm local
// optimum, and tools/permute.py (1801 rewrites, 4.4 min) confirmed no
// meaning-preserving rewrite beats it, so the residue is not a spelling.
//
// An instruction-stream diff against the original leaves exactly FIVE
// structural items, and the whole function is 6 bytes short:
//  1. Two missing `mov ebp, [g_game]` reloads, one after the FUN_004a0bf0 call
//     in each of switch cases 0/1/2 (original 0x47988e and 0x47990d). These are
//     6 bytes each and are the entire size deficit. They only appear if the
//     value in EBP is a *global read*, because a local survives a call
//     unchanged. But this file's `Game_004797e0* game` local is exactly what
//     puts g_game in EBP in the first place: with no local at all, MSVC gives
//     EBP to the scaled index (24*playerIndex) instead and every all-g_game
//     spelling I tried lands at 43.9%. That is the wall, and it is a single
//     allocator coin-flip between two values that both want a callee-saved
//     register. Tried and all <= 84.0: `Game*& game = g_game` (70.1, frame 0x8c),
//     `game = g_game;` again after the switch (57.3), a fresh `Game* game2`
//     for the tail test (67.0), and all 2^7 combinations of the seven
//     `game->` / `g_game->` sites (best single flip 68.2, best pair 79.9,
//     best triple 76.0). The permuter also never found the reload.
//  2. Three extra `mov`s at the head of the duplicate-colour else-block (ours
//     reloads g_game and players, the original keeps players live in ECX from
//     the tail test). Getting the myColor read onto the same `players`/
//     index pair needs `game->players[playerIndex].color` in the for-init,
//     which scores 51.7; the mixed `g_game->` spelling that keeps 84.0% is
//     what forces the reload. A cached `Player* players = game->players` at
//     the tail test is byte-identical to the base (84.0), as is caching it
//     before the switch (76.0 once combined with the dup block).
//  3. The original spills `holder->entries` to [esp+0x14] and reloads it after
//     the "Color%d" wsprintf; ours keeps entries in EBP, which is the same
//     coin-flip as (1): EBP is either g_game or entries.
//  4. FreeColour's exit test. The original emits `cmp ecx,edx; je`; ours emits
//     `xor edx,edx; cmp eax,ecx; sete dl; test dl,dl; jne` because the source
//     says `bool done = k == game->numPlayers; if (done)`. A bare
//     `if (k == game->numPlayers) return n;` DOES produce the original's `je`,
//     but it drops the whole file to 72.9%: it changes the switch-case layout
//     and loses both g_game reloads. This is coupled to (1), so the `bool tmp1`
//     spelling is load-bearing for the prologue even though it is wrong for
//     the exit test. Spellings that keep 84.0%: `int tmp1 = ...` gives 72.9,
//     `bool tmp1 = !(k != ...)`, `bool tmp1 = !(k < ...)` and
//     `game->numPlayers == k` all stay at 84.0 (still `sete`/`setge`).
//  5. Twelve `nop` bytes of tail padding.
// Byte-neutral this pass (all 84.0%, safe to keep or drop): an unused
// `__inline ps()/np()/mn()` accessor pair on Game_004797e0; routing the
// FreeColour inner loop through `Player* ps = game->players` or through
// `(game->players + k)`; dropping the dead `Entry* same2 = entries; entries =
// same2;` self-alias (that one is now removed from this file).
// Inert: N unused `extern int` declarations, N = 0..39, on the `bool tmp1`
// variant, all byte-identical.
// mimo-v2.6-pro retry (issue #4060, 60 min box): base re-verified at 74.1%
// (1024 of 1034 bytes). Confirmed the residue is one register-allocation
// coin-flip, not compiler state: the original keeps g_game in EBP and the
// scaled index (playerIndex*24) in EBX (spilled to [esp+0x10]), while this
// file keeps the scaled index in EBP and spills g_game to [esp+0x1c]. Every
// variant this pass scored <= base: g_game-only body 44.1, cached me/players
// pointer 54.4, named int off=playerIndex*24 + me pointer 35.6, member-address
// int* ctl for the controller 37.2, register Game* game (no-op) 74.1, free
// colour written inline instead of the inlined helper 74.1. Compiler-state
// hammer (N unused extern decls, N=3..300) is byte-identical at 74.1 for every
// N, so the allocation is fixed by the source shape. The prior notes on the
// g_game/game spelling mix (local optimum) still hold: single-spelling swaps
// all regress. Likely natural construct still untried: a shape that forces
// MSVC to rematerialise the scaled index at the final colour store (splitting
// its live range) so g_game wins EBP, e.g. deriving players[playerIndex] only
// where needed rather than one kept scaled temp.
// STATUS (deepseek-v4.1-flash, issue #3686): best is 74.1% (1024 of 1034 bytes), no MATCH.
// What still differs (whole-thing register allocation, not structure): the original
// keeps g_game in EBP for the switch plus the duplicate-colour block and the scaled
// index (playerIndex*24) in EBX, spilling the scaled index to [esp+0x10] at its def
// (EBX is then reused for count, myColour and entries), and spills holder->entries
// to [esp+0x14]. This file instead spills g_game to [esp+0x1c], holds the scaled
// index in EBP and spills players/entries to [esp+0x10]/[esp+0x14]. Also two small
// spots: our count==0 branch emits `push ebx` where the original emits `push 0`, and
// our duplicate-colour scan loads myColour before the numPlayers<=0 test where the
// original sinks it after. All jump targets differ as a consequence. GPT-6.1-sol's
// retry pass for issue #3188 notes below still apply.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash pass (issue #3907, 10 min box): base re-verified at 74.1%
// (1024 of 1034 bytes), 17 check runs. Every single-spelling perturbation of the
// g_game/game mix regresses, so the kept mix is a local optimum: all body via
// game-> 30.0, else-block menus via game-> 27.8, inverted count branch 72.9,
// myColor read via game-> 52.0, final colour store via game-> 51.8, holder->entries
// via g_game-> 57.5, case-2 numPlayers via g_game-> 59.8, the four controller
// stores via g_game-> 52.4, switch/tail test/dup-loop-conditions via g_game->
// 55.3/48.0/46.2, FreeColour passed g_game 40.6, full g_game-only body with every
// local kept 44.1. Byte-neutral (all 74.1, 1024 bytes): hoisted `int mode = (count
// == 0)`, named switch selector `int ctl = ...; switch (ctl)`, and `register
// Game_004797e0* game`. The residue is therefore one allocator coin-flip (g_game
// vs the scaled index for ebp) that no single spelling reaches.
// GPT-6.1-sol retry pass for issue #3188: baseline and tested variants scored
// at most 74.1% (7 checker invocations, one returned no output, no MATCH).
// Keep the staged v4 below.
// Explicit controller if/else fell to 71.3%; pointer iteration and a while(1)
// free-colour loop tied the existing score. Remaining differences include
// broad register allocation shifts around the indexed player base and scan loops.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash round-6 adoption: staged candidate v4 (one of the
// g_game-spelling variants in build/scratch/0x4797e0/) scored 74.1% (1024 of
// 1034 bytes) and replaces the previous 58.9% base. Same-batch scores:
// v3 46.2, v5 72.1, v6 72.7, v7 52.6. The root-cause note below (lea vs reload
// of &players[playerIndex].color) explains why the g_game spellings win.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash pass (issue #2872): verified 58.9% (986 of 1034 bytes),
// stopped early per the fleet watchdog. The frame is add esp,0x48 vs the
// original add esp,0x88: the original has a second 64-byte buffer at fb+0x58
// (the "Color%d" string passed to FUN_0049fdf0) that our one-buffer version
// lacks; adding one has always regressed the score via spill differences
// (52.0 best with two buffers). Also ours spills game->players to [esp+0x10]
// and the address of players[playerIndex].color to [esp+0x14] where the
// original keeps the former in ecx (reloading) and rematerializes the latter.
// Best 58.9%, no MATCH. Original 1034 bytes, ours 986.
// Fixed the big register-role swap: never reassign the `game` local after the switch
// (a `game = g_game;` no-op split its live range and forced the scaled index into ebp,
// g_game into edx, and an extra stack temp). With one continuous `game` variable MSVC
// now emits ebp = g_game, ebx = 24*playerIndex, exactly like the original; 48.5 -> 58.9.
// Remaining differences:
//  1. Frame 0x48 vs original 0x88: the original has TWO 64-byte buffers (wsprintf at
//     [fb+0x18] and a second at [fb+0x58] used only for the "Color%d" passed to
//     FUN_0049fdf0). Ours has only the first. Adding a second buffer makes frame 0x8c
//     (52.0%) because ours spills three values rather than two.
//  2. Ours spills game->players to [esp+0x10] before the tail condition and keeps it
//     across the if-branch calls; the original keeps players in ecx and reloads it,
//     so no spil. Ours also materializes and spills the address of
//     players[playerIndex].color ([esp+0x14]) between the myColor read and the later
//     store; the original re-materializes that address instead.
// Tried this pass: game declared before wsprintf (36.5%), second 64-byte buffer (44.1%),
// buffer[128] with buffer+64 as the second (44.4%), v4 + second buffer (52.0%),
// tail via g_game directly (33.6%). The one-buffer core (this file) is the best.
// Earlier passes (see git history): no-alias g_game-only 36.9%, no-alias + myColor 44.1%,
// larger/smaller buffers 44-48%.
