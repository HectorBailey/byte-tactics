// Ground height under a unit's footprint: walks the rectangle of map cells the
// unit covers and keeps the lowest cell floor over the cells whose footprint
// mask has bit 3 set, plus the highest floor over the cells with bit 3 and the
// highest floor over the cells with bit 4 set. The bit 4 maximum is never read
// (see the bug note), so the result is the low value, or the water surface
// minus the type's draft when no mask bit was set at all.
// The declaration order matters: y before the footprint copy before x is what
// gives g_game ebx and cell.y si, as in the original.
//
// PARTIAL: 99.1%, one instruction out. The footprint mask load is
// `mov al, [edi+esi]` here (mask pointer in the base slot, the mask index in
// the index slot) where the original has `mov al, [esi+edi]`, so MSVC picked
// the other operand as the base of that memory reference. Nothing in the
// source moved it: the index type (int, unsigned, a separate unsigned),
// subscript versus explicit pointer arithmetic, a local copy of the mask
// pointer, the order of the index declaration, an explicit cast of the result
// and incrementing the index in a separate statement were all tried, and
// tools/headers.py (128 sets) plus 20 unused extern declarations in front
// (the compiler-state probe from the guide) all score the same or worse. The
// same swap only appears (with the mask in esi and the index in edi, which the
// rest of the function then gets wrong) when the index is declared before the
// cell pointer. Treated as the guide's "operand order that nothing changes"
// case: one SIB byte, compiler state, move on.
