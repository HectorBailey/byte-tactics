// Decompiled by space-bunny-free. Names are provisional.
// PARTIAL, 92.1% (665 bytes against 640). Every instruction from the prologue
// to the last search loop matches the original, including the two inlined name
// searches; what is left is one instruction in the third search and the closing
// float block. Details at the bottom.
//
// What the function is: the list gadget's "put line N of the entry called NAME
// at the top of the window" step, the one 0x4a99c0 (scroll down) calls at its
// end with `(char*)me + 2`. It finds the table entry whose +0x02 name matches,
// stores the line into that entry's +0xba, makes the language entry of the
// entry's tab (+0x28) current, works out the pixel step of one line from the
// current font, and when the line has fallen out of the visible window moves the
// window's top (+0xbc) to it, clamped to +0xbe. It then finds the entry of type
// 4 that shares this entry's +0x01 byte (the scrollbar), rescales that
// scrollbar's +0x140 from this entry's +0x136, and stamps +0xcca.
//
// The three structural facts that decide the code, all confirmed against the
// original and all worth double digit percentages:
//
//  1. Both name searches are the `static inline FindEntry` helper that the
//     matched siblings 0x4a0090, 0x4a0180, 0x4a0200 and 0x49ff90 use. Written
//     out by hand as `int found = -1; for (...) { found = i; break; }` the same
//     function scores 30.8% instead of 86.6%: the helper's `return i` /
//     `return -1` pair is what puts the -1 into the loop's exit block
//     (`or ecx,0xffffffff` at 0x4a2e90) and frees the index register, and the
//     caller's own index has to be declared AFTER the first call so it can have
//     that register.
//  2. The test at 0x4a2f7d is a short circuit OR, not an AND. `jg` jumps INTO
//     the block and the following `cmp di,bx / jge` jumps over it, so the source
//     is `sel > step + last - 1 || sel < last`.
//  3. `k` (the type 4 entry's index) and `pkind` (the byte it is matched on)
//     have to be declared at function scope, and `k` must NOT be initialised.
//     Declared inside the if, or initialised, MSVC 5 gives one of them a stack
//     home, pushes a fifth register and moves every [esp+N] displacement
//     (77.3% and 50.1%). With the pair at function scope the not-found path
//     compiles to the original's register with one instruction still missing,
//     see (a) below.
//
// What still differs:
//
//  a. 0x4a3037. The original's not-found path for the type 4 search is
//     `xor ecx,ecx`, that is `k` zeroed, which is what `int k = 0;` would give.
//     With the initialiser present MSVC 5 materialises k in a stack slot
//     instead and the whole function drops to 77.3%, so the initialiser is left
//     off here and this one instruction reads a stale argument slot instead of
//     zero. Behaviourally the original scans entry 0 when the list has no type 4
//     entry sharing the +0x01 byte; this build indexes whatever is in that slot.
//     That is the one place where the partial is not behaviour faithful.
//
//  b. 0x4a3077 and 0x4a307f. The original multiplies and divides with the
//     integer memory forms `fimul dword [esp+0x18]` / `fidiv dword [esp+0x18]`;
//     this file gets `fild` / `fmulp st(1),st` / `fild` / `fdivp st(1),st`, four
//     instructions longer. MSVC 5 only picks `fimul m32int` when the right
//     operand is a plain int variable; giving the two divisors int locals does
//     produce the memory forms, but they then take stack homes of their own and
//     the temporaries move to +0x20 and +0x10 (76.4%).
//
//  c. 0x4a308f to 0x4a30a2. The original is `test ah,0x40 / jne` with the
//     branch landing on the out of line `fstp st(0)`, and the store arm ending
//     in an unconditional `jmp` over that `fstp` so the two arms share one copy
//     of the tail: that is the code for "store when field_140 <= quotient", laid
//     out the way MSVC lays out an if/else. This file gets `test ah,0x41 / je`
//     with the branch landing on a second, out of line copy of the whole tail
//     (the `fstp st(0)` at 0x4a262 here is on the store path instead). Every
//     relational spelling of `<=` tried here compiles to `test ah,0x41` or
//     `test ah,0x1`; `!=` does produce 0x40 but then branches the other way
//     round the block, and writing the statement as a ternary, which is what
//     would give the if/else layout, makes MSVC spill the quotient to a qword
//     temporary (`fstp QWORD PTR` / `fcom QWORD PTR`), twelve instructions
//     worse (73.8%).
//
// Second pass (space-bunny-free, 92.1% to 92.6%, 10 runs): the original computes the
// quotient ONCE (fild 136, fimul bc, fidiv be, fild 140, fcomp st(1), then ftol on the
// same stack value), and its branch is test ah,0x40 / jne, which is what != gives, so
// (c) is fixed by writing ield_140 != q (arm layout still differs only because of
// (b)). Tried for (b): int locals with two full expressions (right layout AND fimul,
// but locals get homes at +0x20/+0x10, frame +4, 76.9% or worse), (int) casts inline,
// implicit short operands, and a double q with int locals (this file, fmulp form).
// fimul appears only when the int locals are used in two separate expressions.
//
// Suspected original bugs: none beyond the two edges noted above. The type 4
// search is unguarded (no entry of type 4 sharing the byte means entry 0 is
// rescaled), and the second FindEntry result is used without a -1 check, which
// is safe only because the name matched on the way in and nothing has changed it
// since.
