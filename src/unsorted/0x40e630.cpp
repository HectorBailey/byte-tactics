// #5526 Codex recheck: 99.7%; documented Cost push and Clear scheduling differences remain.
// Claude Opus 5.5 (#4601, 2026-10-04), 98.3% -> 99.7%: the heap reset now
// comes first in the tail and the cell index is computed by an inline
// Grid::Index(x, y). With the index written inline, MSVC proves the four heap
// stores do not alias the width load and sinks them into the dirty-word OR
// (97.6% with Clear() first, 98.3% with it after the flags store); computed
// inside an inlined Grid method the width load is no longer provably separate,
// so the stores stay as one group right after the start.x/start.y loads, as in
// the original. (Clear() first plus Grid::Index, or a Grid::Open that also
// does the dirty and flags updates, both give 99.7%; Index after the node
// constructor and Clear() between them gives 99.3%.) Heap-as-base-class,
// Heap*/Heap& aliases, `int&` reset helpers and a field-by-field node do not
// move the group; only the index helper does.
// What is left is the one `push ebp`: the `__fastcall` 3-argument Cost below
// is a stand-in, not the original. 0x40da40 (0 callers in the exe) is the
// out-of-line copy of this class's inline Cost, and it is a plain thiscall
// `target->Cost(x, y)` with the arguments in edx and the vtable in eax, as
// inlined here. Written that way (int or __int64 return, every operand order,
// a Scale/Estimate pair copied from the matched sibling 0x40da70, FixMul,
// locals for x/y/target/result, short/ref/Point parameters, inline wrappers
// for IsGoal/Cost/InBounds) it is 94.2% everywhere: the code is right but the
// eax/ecx/edx rotation is one step off from the Cost call on (Cost args
// eax/vtable edx, InBounds start.x ecx/width eax, Release objects eax and edx
// instead of edx and ecx). c2prio --rotation: the IsGoal call starts with the
// pointer at edx and ends at ecx, and the original needs it at eax when Cost's
// vtable is taken, so the original has one more temporary (taken while ecx is
// busy) between the two calls, or evaluates Cost's y before the vtable. No
// statement there moves it: dead stores, a do-while(0), status/target/goal
// locals, `!= 0`, the finish block at the end or with two Finish() copies (no
// tail merge: 895 to 915 bytes), and ResetTable/MarkGoal/Cost/Release/Finish
// defined out of class in the exe's order (they still inline) are all
// identical. Deleting the whole `if (d < bestDist)` block gives the original's
// Cost and Release registers, but only because IsGoal then starts at eax.
// Two 15 minute permuter runs on the thiscall form (13263 candidates from the
// 92.8% file, 17334 at seed 12 from the 94.2% one) found nothing.
// Scratch: build/scratch/0x40e630/ (this2.cpp is the 94.2% thiscall
// version; costregs.py prints the Cost/Release registers of any variant).
// 30-min checkpoint (space-bunny-free, best 98.3%, unchanged from main), plus
// the last 15 minutes: the two levers from the guide also come out flat here.
// A dead store in a statically folded branch does rotate the `Cost` handout
// (all ten spellings of `int t = 0; if (t) s = 1;` and up to three of them at
// once give the argument temporaries eax/edx and the vtable ebx), but it never
// reaches the original's edx/edx/eax, and in the `Cost(x, x, y)` shape it only
// moves the second argument's temporary from ebx to eax. Ten uncalled
// `static inline` file-scope helpers (int/unsigned short accessors, a FixMul
// clone, a flags accessor, a heap resetter) change neither the fastcall nor the
// thiscall nor the `Cost(x, x, y)` shape by a byte. For the Clear() group, dead
// stores that name the same fields, self-assignments (`d = d;`, `i = i;`,
// `heap.count = heap.count;`, `d.pos = d.pos;`), a comma expression putting
// `heap.Clear()` inside the NodeData constructor's argument list or inside the
// index expression, Clear() bodies that route the four values through a local or
// through a chained read of `count`, and a two-level pointer cast are all
// exactly 98.3%. The group is emitted where its statement stands, and when it
// stands early it is spread through the dirty-word OR instead of staying one
// block, so the original's slot (between the ctor's argument loads and its
// body stores) is not reachable from any statement order. tools/permute.py
// found nothing in 2937 candidates at the default seed and nothing in 3379 at
// seed 11; seeds 12 and 13 are the obvious next thing to try. Ten more uncalled
// helpers, one and two at a time, before or after the class, inline or not, a
// multi-statement one and a class member accessor, are all byte-identical. The
// clearest lead left: the original's two pushes imply a 3-parameter fastcall
// called as `Cost(x, x, y)`, which reproduces the push order, the edx
// argument and the eax vtable, and only misses because the second argument's
// temporary is handed ebx with both loads hoisted; and the Clear() group is
// emitted exactly where its statement stands, so the original's source has it
// between the NodeData constructor's argument loads and its body stores, which
// no plain statement order produces.
//
// 30-min checkpoint (space-bunny-free, best 98.3%, unchanged from main): the two
// hunks are still the extra `push ebp` and the four Clear() stores one block
// late. Measured again on this base, all flat or worse: the whole 6x6 matrix of
// narrow/int first-and-second parameter types for the virtual `Cost`
// (`short`/`unsigned short`/`char`/`unsigned char`/`int`/`long`): 16-bit first +
// 32-bit second gives 96.6 (the InBounds and Release registers then match and
// only the call block is wrong), 32-bit/32-bit 92.8, 16-bit/16-bit 93.2, so the
// 98.3 fastcall shape is still the best. `Cost(x, x, y)` (the push order the
// original's two pushes imply for a 3-parameter fastcall) scores 93.8 for all
// 216 type combinations: the second argument's temporary goes to ebx and both
// loads stay at the top instead of sinking the x load into edx. A thiscall
// 2-parameter call keeps the register reuse but hands the argument temporaries
// eax and the vtable edx, the exact mirror of the original, and no argument
// spelling (x+0, y*1, a folded ternary, an Identity wrapper, two-pointer reads,
// a target local) nor an extra dead statement moves that: the dead store
// (`int t = 0; if (t) s = 1;`) does rotate the handout, to eax/edx/ebx with the
// loads both at the top, never to edx/edx/eax. For the Clear() group, all eight
// source positions were re-swept: positions 0, 1 and 2 score 97.6 with the four
// stores spread through the dirty-word OR region instead of landing as one
// block at the top, and the spelling of the group makes no difference at all
// (member call, a free helper taking `Heap*` or `void*`, four explicit stores,
// one statement), only its position does. Dead stores around the group and a
// `*(float*)&global` node, and ctor bodies that reorder or add a self-assign,
// are all exactly 98.3%. The group is emitted in the source order of its
// statement, and the original needs it between the ctor's argument loads and
// its body stores, which no statement order reaches.
//
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (#4170 round, new best 98.3%): the big lever is the
// Target_0040e630 virtual `Cost` calling convention. Declaring it
// `virtual int __fastcall Cost(int x, int y, int z)` and calling it as
// `target->Cost(x, y, 0)` makes MSVC 5 put the argument temporaries in edx and
// the vtable in eax exactly like the original, which fixes three of the four
// old hunks (the InBounds width/x pair, both inlined Release object pointers
// and the freed-buffer register). Other conventions: 2-param `__fastcall`
// (1 push + edx arg) gives 94.7, `__stdcall` (this pushed) 93.7, plain
// thiscall 92.8, 16-bit virtual params 93.2. Remaining two hunks (880 bytes,
// 98.3%):
//   A. the fastcall third argument emits `push ebp` (0) before `push edx` (y)
//      where the original has `push edx` (y) then, after `movsx edx,x` and the
//      vtable load, `push edx` (x); i.e. the original is a 2-argument call and
//      the fastcall trick cannot drop its third push. `Cost(x, x, y)` has the
//      right push order but the allocator then puts y in ebx (93.8);
//      `Cost(x, y, 0)` with the third argument spelled as a different
//      expression only ever moves the push slot, never removes it.
//   D. the four `heap.Clear()` stores still land after the flags store instead
//      of between `movsx edx,ax` and `mov word ptr [esp+0x22],ax`; the
//      Clear()-position sweep (8 positions, including Clear() as the g
//      argument of the NodeData constructor) keeps the current placement best.
// Everything else in the function is byte-identical.
//
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (#4073 round): hoisting `heap.Clear();` ahead of the tail d(i) work (two placements: before NodeData and after it) both drop 92.8 to 92.1, so the 0x40e807 store group is not source-hoistable; baseline re-confirmed at 92.8% (880 bytes).
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (#3770 round): still 92.8% (880 bytes, exact), same four hunks.
// Two more shapes are flat: splitting `int cost; cost = Cost(start.x, start.y);`
// into two statements and moving the inlined Release body of Finish() into
// explicit Object_0040e630*/Dummy_00440be0* temps (`ow->FUN_00440be0(ob);`) both
// print the same 92.8% with byte-identical code, so the Cost argument temps and
// the two inlined Release register choices are not statement-shape levers.

// deepseek-v4.1-flash (#3265 round): hoisting the inlined heap.Clear() to before NodeData d() / i = ... (or between i = ... and the dirty OR) scores 92.1 (881->880 bytes), both spellings interleave the four heap reset stores into the dirty OR region around `shr edx,8`; the 92.8 position after `grid.cells[i].flags |= 1;` stays best. Remaining diffs unchanged: Start/A* virtual-call arg registers (eax/edx vs edx/eax), the movsx ecx/edx pair at the bounds test, Release() object pointer in eax vs edx, and the Clear() store slot.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (#3023 retry): still 92.8% (880 bytes, exact). Four hunks:
// Cost/bounds registers use eax/edx where the original uses edx/eax and ecx/eax;
// both inlined Release() sites pick object/owner registers opposite to the original
// (hunk B also swaps the freed-buffer reg); the contiguous four-store heap reset
// group lands one block later. Structure, frame, callees, branches and the inlined
// Push/vector code match. Signed InBounds+casts, Clear()-first, object/owner temps
// and sx/sy locals score 81.3-92.8; 128 header sets flat. Allocator/scheduler tie.
// Starts a path search for the object at +0x58: marks every goal cell the
// target reports, picks the goal nearest to the start as the probe's aim,
// runs the straight-line probe (0x40e160) and, when that did not reach a
// goal, seeds the open heap with the start cell.
//
// Partial (92.8%): structure, stack layout, callee-saved registers, every
// branch and the inlined heap/vector code match; only four hunks differ.
// All four are allocator/scheduler state, not source shape:
//   1. the virtual Cost call at 0x40e762 uses edx for both argument
//      temporaries and eax for the vtable (ours eax/edx); the bounds check
//      that follows loads width into ecx and start.x into eax (ours
//      start.x ecx / width eax);
//   2. the inlined Release on the out-of-bounds path loads object into edx
//      (ours eax) and the deleted goal buffer into eax (ours ecx);
//   3. the heap reset stores are a contiguous group in the original,
//      placed right after the start.x/start.y loads and before the node's
//      y store; ours now emits the same four stores contiguously (this is
//      the hunk the reordering below improved) but after the flags store
//      and before the dir computation. The depth store still lands after
//      `mov ebx,[edx]` (original: before `shr edx,8`) and `mov ebx,[edx]`
//      still follows `and ecx,0x1f` (original: precedes it);
//   4. the final Release loads object into ecx before pushing it (ours
//      edx and pushes later).
// Tried without effect (all stay at 92.1%): heap.Clear() vs four direct
// stores vs a local Heap*; the node as a named local, a temporary in Push,
// or declared before Clear; computing the cell index before Clear; a
// Point/short local for start; FixMul vs the spelled-out 64-bit multiply;
// a stored goal result and `!= 0` conditions (slightly worse, 91.8%);
// Free Release/Finish helpers; a swapped NodeData constructor argument
// order and a constructor argument-order change (much worse). An inline
// helper for the open-list setup exhausts the /Ob2 budget (the node
// constructor goes out of line). All 128
// tools/headers.py sets also give 92.1%, so this is most likely TU
// compiler state, the same wall as 0x40d290, 0x408f30 and 0x40cca0.
// Also tried by deepseek-v4.1, all at or below 92.1%: InBounds written as
// `width > x && height > y` (90.4), an IsGoal bool local (91.8), Cost
// without its `s` local (87.8), the index computed before Clear (73.6, it
// grows/swaps a frame slot), a Point copy of start (61.7), and two Release
// local-temp orders (92.1 each); the four hunks below never move.
// deepseek-v4.1 re-run: tried unsigned-local InBounds operands (frame 909B, 80.3%);
// the best version stays this one at 92.1%.
// deepseek-v4.1 third pass (10 check runs): a named result local in Cost (884
// bytes, 87.7%), Clear() moved after the node construction (92.1), short Cost
// parameters (92.1), a target local in Cost (92.1), Cost hand-inlined at the
// call site (92.1), Release(object) with the object as a parameter (92.1), and
// the de Morgan bounds test written out at the tail (909 bytes, 80.3). The four
// hunks never moved, so they stay allocator state, not source shape.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash retry: a brute statement-order search over the tail
// block (all 180 orders of Clear/node/index/dirty/flags/dir keeping index
// first of the three that use it) found one improvement: moving heap.Clear()
// after the dirty and flags stores groups the four heap-reset stores into one
// contiguous block and takes the score to 92.8%. Every other order is at or
// below 92.1%. Variants tried at 92.8 or below with no further gain: explicit
// four-store Clear forms (three internal orders), short sx/sy node locals,
// the node declared before Clear, a `static inline void ClearHeap(Heap*)`
// free helper, reversed Cost multiply, and adding <windows.h>/<string.h>/
// <memory.h>. The clear group still lands one block later than the original
// (after flags, before dir) and the two Release sites and the Cost/bounds
// registers are unchanged. The original's clear group sits before the node
// pos stores; no source order of these six statements reaches that slot, so
// it remains scheduler state.
