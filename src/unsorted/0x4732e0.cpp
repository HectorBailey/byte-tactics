// RETRY deepseek-v4.1-flash (issue 3150): ~35 more scored scratch variants,
// none above the kept 534-byte / 81.1% dest-first do-while. New this pass and
// all worse: the real <vector> header 57.9%/547B; member
// _Ucopy(_P,_Last,_Q+_M) 58.0%; a named dest local plus the real helper 58.0%;
// source-first 55.2%; do-while with a cached _Last 59.8%/538B (for + cache
// 58.0%); a dest-first helper _Ucopy(_P,_F,_L) 71.6%; copy(_P,_Last,_Q+_M)
// 71.7%; copy(_Last,_Q+_M,_P) 76.2%; allocator.construct(_Q+_M,*_P) 56.0%.
// Dest spelling variations (_d = _Q then += _M, &_Q[_M]), a while(1)/break,
// and `if (_d) *_d = *_s` all tie at 81.1%. Writing the source start as the
// original's arithmetic order ((_P - _Q) + _d - _M) is 72 to 74%.
// Root cause, confirmed again: _P is loaded into ecx in the original but into
// edi here after the operator new call; that single choice cascades into the
// _Ufill loop (count esi/_X edi original, count ecx/_X esi here) and into the
// third copy (source ecx/dest eax/_Last cached esi/M4 edi original, source
// eax/dest ecx/M4 esi/_Last reloaded here). Every construct that routes _P
// into ecx also flips `this` back to ebx, and every construct that keeps
// this=ebp leaves _P in edi. No source lever in this file reaches it, which
// matches the guide's note that 0x4732e0 is translation-unit state.
//
// RETRY deepseek-v4.1-flash: 8 more scored variants, none above the kept
// 534-byte / 81.1% dest-first do-while. Calling the member _Ucopy(_P, _Last,
// _Q + _M) is 58.0%/546B; an iterator& alias for the source is 60.3%; every
// dest-first pre-tested form is 80.5%/541B; _d/_s pointer types and the dest
// spelling (&_Q[_M], _d = _Q then +=_M) do not move 81.1%. The growth branch
// still colours dest in ecx and source in eax (original: dest eax, source
// ecx, _Last cached in esi, _M*4 in edi) and is 3 bytes short.
//
// RETRY deepseek-v4.1-flash (issue 2433): re-confirmed the growth branch wall
// from scratch, 9 scored variants, none above the 81.1% do-while base in this
// file. New measurements this pass: a for-loop with the destination declared
// first is 541 bytes / 80.5% (not 537); swapping the two increments in the
// do-while, or the comparison order `_Last != _s`, stays 81.1% (identical
// bytes); pre-testing the do-while with `if (_s != _Last)` is 541 / 80.5%;
// source-first for and do-while are 531 / 72.4% and 524 / 55.2%; using the _P
// parameter itself as the third-copy induction variable (mutating _P, in
// do-while, for and while shapes) is 529 bytes / 59.9% for all three, because
// it reverts `this` to ebx, confirming the source-copy local is what keeps the
// this=ebp allocation. Writing the construct as `if (_d) *_d = *_s;` is byte
// identical to the allocator.construct spelling. The blocker is unchanged:
// our third copy colors dest in ecx and src in eax with _Last reloaded, while
// the original colors dest in eax and src in ecx with _Last cached in esi and
// _M*4 in edi. That single coloring decision also keeps P in ecx in the
// original versus edi here.
// std::vector<Class_00471cc0*>::insert(iterator, size_type, const T&) from MSVC 5's
// <vector>, with _Ucopy, _Ufill, fill and copy_backward inlined. The sixteen
// push_back sites call it out of line (they inline the count-is-one overload
// instead). Taking the member's address makes the compiler emit the template
// instantiation out of line, as in the original file. The member pointer must
// return void: spelled with an iterator return, VC5 resolves the wrong
// overload (C2563, or C2440 with a cast), because it prefers the two-argument
// insert.
//
// NEW (space-bunny-free, #1864): the "this in ebx, count in ebp" wall that
// seven passes wrote off as translation-unit state is NOT a wall, and the file
// now scores 81.1% instead of 57.9%. The lever is the sibling family's
// (0x425480, 0x40d020, same swap): hand the vector class itself and write the
// growth branch's THIRD copy as an explicit loop in insert's body, destination
// declared BEFORE the source. That flips the whole register allocation of the
// function to the original's, `this` in ebp and the count in ebx, with the two
// moves in the original's order. The real <vector> cannot express it, because
// its body calls _Ucopy(_P, _Last, _Q + _M) there.
// Both loop shapes were measured in this base (check.py --sym, both scored):
//   do { ... } while (_s != _Last);        81.1%, 534 of 537 bytes  <- kept
//   for (; _s != _Last; ++_d, ++_s) ...   80.5%, 541 of 537 bytes
// The original pre-tests that loop (`cmp ecx, esi / je`, _Last cached in esi),
// so the for form is the structurally faithful spelling and is one `}` away if
// the remaining rotation is ever fixed; the do-while form is kept because it
// scores higher. Adding a `const_iterator _e = _Last;` cache reverts the
// whole allocation to this-in-ebx in both shapes (58.0% for the for, 59.8% for
// the do-while), which is the cache-clobber the sibling files record.
//
// Still differs (81.1%): everything is in the growth branch. The original
// caches _Last in esi for the third copy and builds its source start as
// `(P - Q) + dest - M4` (`sub ecx,edx / add ecx,eax / sub ecx,edi`), keeping
// _P in ecx and the destination in eax. Here the third copy re-reads
// `mov edx, [ebp+8]` each pass, derives the source as
// `lea eax,[ecx+edi] / sub eax,edx / sub eax,esi` from the destination, and
// keeps _P in edi with the destination in ecx; _M*4 sits in esi where the
// original has esi holding _Last. The first _Ucopy's loop end is edi here
// against ecx in the original, and the _Ufill counter is ecx here against esi
// in the original. That is one allocator decision about which induction
// variable leads the third copy, the same wall 0x425480 records; the fast
// branches match instruction for instruction and only differ in branch
// targets.
