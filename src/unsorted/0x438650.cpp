// Decompiled by Opus, edited by deepseek-v4.1. Names are provisional.
// Codex / GPT-6 retest in #13:
// signed intermediate products, a scale helper and a widened
// multiplier did not preserve both load order and unsigned float conversion.
// Retain the original best partial, including its redundant 16-bit mask.
//
// deepseek-v4.1 in #1995: 0x437a50 is a byte-identical twin of this function
// (same unit offsets, same 10.0f / 300.0f constants, only the _ftol call and
// the jg target differ) and it has NO "and edx, 0xffff", so a mask-free source
// does exist. A cast-free product of the same four factors gives 52.9%: MSVC5
// computes the division into edx first and loads field_1fe afterwards, so the
// accumulator is edx, not edi. Every narrowing cast tried, (unsigned short),
// (short), (unsigned char), restores the original A-first order and the exact
// original registers, but always appends "and edx, 0xffff" (or the matching
// mask) and turns the file into 167 bytes vs 161. MSVC5 does not elide that
// mask even when the value range is obvious: a micro-test whose operand is an
// unsigned short parameter still emits it, so no cast spelling removes it.
// Still differs by that one instruction (and the jg target it shifts,
// 0x4386e9 vs 0x4386ef).
//
// deepseek-v4.1 retest in #1995: the "twin at 0x437a50" note above is wrong.
// 0x437a50 sits inside Class_00437a30 (a container grow routine) and the whole
// exe has exactly one "fcomp dword [0x4fd2a4]" site, at 0x438665, so there is
// no second copy of this function to copy a mask-free shape from. New variants
// tried this session (signed int field_1fa with an unsigned third parameter,
// the same with only the last factor cast, (unsigned int) around the whole
// product, a q local of int/unsigned int declared before the product, an
// assignment of q inside the product, and moving the (unsigned short) cast to
// the C factor) all reproduce one of two shapes: 96.6% with the mask, or the
// 52.9% shape where MSVC hoists the magic division by 5 above the field_1fe
// load (accumulator edx instead of edi, b->type homed in edi instead of esi).
// Every 16-bit narrowing of the quotient forces the original order and always
// pays the 6-byte and edx,0xffff, so the order and the mask appear to be the
// same front-end decision and this file stays at 96.6%.
// Tried and rejected: all 24 factor orders of (field_1fe, (field_b8+5)/5,
// field_1fa, n) and two-part groupings, an unsigned int numerator local
// (declared first, declared after the float, assigned later, ++-style `*=`
// chain), the operands read through extra locals and pointers, widened casts
// and redundant casts on either side, +0 / *1 / |0 / 0u pads, 5u and
// (unsigned short)5 divisors, float and double conversions of the product,
// and an unsigned short local for the division result.
//
// deepseek-v4.1-flash retest in #3010 (this session). The original's integer
// block is exactly "A -> edx, save A -> edi, division -> edx, A * q -> edi,
// * field_1fa, * n", so the source has the field_1fe load *before* the
// division, which in the default compiler state only a code-emitting operand
// produces. New evidence:
//   * statement structure: `int p = field_1fe; p = p * ((b8+5)/5);
//     p = p * field_1fa; p = p * n;` with a *signed* final division
//     ((int)p / (v*300.0f)) compiles to 77.6%: the integer block above,
//     byte for byte, with the original's esi/edi/edx allocation. It differs
//     only in the frame (no sub esp,8, no mov [esp+0xc],0) and in
//     "fild dword" instead of "fild qword". Making the final conversion
//     unsigned (any of: (unsigned int)p / (v*300.0f), an unsigned int u = p
//     copy, a (float)/(double) cast, unsigned __int64, a union, an array
//     element, an inlined helper, an unsigned int chain, references) collapses
//     the statements back to the 52.9% shape in every case (about 40
//     spellings). So the unsigned conversion and the preserved statement order
//     are mutually exclusive in this compiler state.
//   * bitfield left operand: declaring field_1fe as `unsigned int : 16` gives
//     92.0% and the original's exact order and registers (A is evaluated
//     first, accumulator edi); it differs only in the A load:
//     "mov edi,[ecx+0x1fe]; and edi,0xffff" instead of the original's
//     "xor edx,edx; mov dx,[ecx+0x1fe]; mov edi,edx" (one byte longer, 162).
//     `unsigned short : 16` emits no mask and does NOT flip the order (52.9%),
//     so the flip comes from the operand needing an extra instruction, not
//     from the bitfield node. The bitfield mask is unavoidable for that type.
//   * compiler state: 128 header sets, N = 0..600 dummy extern ints, N = 0..300
//     dummy structs and the full UnitType/Unit declarations from 0x402640 all
//     leave the no-cast expression at 77.3% (161 bytes, but the chain
//     reassociated to F*A, q, n and b->type in ecx), and drop the cast version
//     to 74.2%. No state tried flips the no-cast expression to the original's
//     A-first chain.
// Best lead for the next attempt: find a source whose *left* operand needs a
// register during evaluation but emits no instruction (the z16 bitfield flip
// without the mask), or a compiler state that preserves the statement order
// with the unsigned conversion (the s05/y01 block above is the proof that the
// order is reachable; only the conversion differs).
//
// What still differs (96.6%): one extra "and edx, 0xffff" before
// "imul edi, edx", which shifts the jg target (0x4386ef vs 0x4386e9).
