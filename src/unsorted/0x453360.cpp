// Decompiled by deepseek-v4.1-flash. Names are provisional.
// PARTIAL (54.4% with the current check.py diff), best found. Sends a
// chat/text message (type 5, up to 64 characters) to the players selected
// by the game's chat mode at +0x2bf0. The whole control flow, every offset
// and constant, and the inlined FUN_0044fe00 target search match. The
// original reloads the `text` argument dead into eax at the start of both
// mode branches, which keeps g_game in ecx; without that dead use MSVC keeps
// g_game in eax and rotates every scratch register by one. Tried and ruled
// out: unused inlined-helper parameters, void-cast locals, folded
// ternaries/commas, text[0] guards, member/__fastcall/__stdcall helpers,
// block-scoped locals, and all 128 header sets. /O2 eliminates every
// construct that could produce the reload.
//
// Notes from Claude Opus 5.5 (#228): the N-declarations test (0 to 400
// unused externs) stays at 54.4% for every N, so the source shape is wrong,
// not the compiler state. Whatever holds eax is already there right after
// strncpy: the original's inlined FUN_0044fe00 loop keeps i in eax and
// g_game in ecx (ours swaps them), and in the mode 1/2 loop the mode byte
// sits in dl and the mode 1 ally test becomes `cmp byte ptr [m], 0` because
// no byte register is free. Also tried, none moving g_game to ecx: loop-only
// inline helpers taking `text` (loop inside or outside the helper), per-index
// helpers for the id, player, selection and ally reads, one function-scope
// `i` for all three loops (with the target search written in place too), a
// switch on the mode, `text[0] == '+'` or the buffer setup moved into inline
// helpers, `if (text) {}` or `strlen(text);` inside and before the loops, a
// `char* t = text` walked with the loop, `text` reused to hold the buffer
// pointer before each send, and an unused `ok` result local.
//
// Retry pass 2 (deepseek-v4.1-flash, #1683): measured the remaining gap as
// exactly (a) the home register of g_game after strncpy (original: ecx; ours:
// eax, which rotates every downstream operand and the find-target index) and
// (b) two missing `mov eax, [esp+0x14]` dead reloads of `text` at the top of
// the mode-3 and default branches (8 of the 9 lost bytes). Those two reloads
// are what keeps eax busy so g_game takes ecx. None of these reproduced the
// reload or the register home: the target search as an inlined member function
// (`g_game->FindTarget()`, same 54.4%), `char* res = strncpy(...)` unused,
// `char* t = text;` declared at the top of each else branch (both 54.4%,
// eliminated), and `text != 0` added to the mode-3 loop guard (52.3%, moved
// text into ebp and changed the prologue). An empty inlined helper called with
// `text` in both branches is folded away (54.4%). The reload is a load with no
// consumer, so it most likely comes from an inlined function or macro that
// takes `text` and drops it in that path, not from any spelling of these loops.
//
// Retry pass (same model): an inline helper for the `text[0] == '+'` test is
// byte-identical to this file; an inline `while(1)` target search (the shape
// required in the sibling 0x453010) scores 46.7, a hoisted `int mode` local
// 46.1, and a live `text` local 46.9, all in the same swapped-register basin.
// So the diff is not the search shape or the '+' test wording.
