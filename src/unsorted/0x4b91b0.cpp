// Builds the "lens" displacement frame that 0x420620 asks for with
// (22, 22, 8): a GAF-style frame header with two w*h buffers of 16-bit cells.
// Each cell inside radius w/4 of the centre holds the offset (in cells) to
// the source pixel of a magnifying lens; the others hold 0x7d00 (no
// displacement).
//
// claude-opus-5-5 (#4733): 55.9% -> 99.3% (423 of 423 bytes). The earlier
// "register family" notes were all symptoms of four source-shape errors:
//  - The header set-up is the real FUN_004b8e00 inlined (alloc w*h*2 cells
//    plus a 0x18 header, width, plane0/plane1, height, zeroed x/y/flags).
//    It has no null check of its own, which is why the stores come before
//    the null test. The copy below (width, plane0, height, plane1) MATCHES
//    0x4b8e00 out of line as well; the order in 0x4b8e00's own file
//    (plane0, height, plane1, width) also matches there but costs 1.4
//    points here, because inlined it stores height before width.
//  - The cells pointer is a `p` local read from f->plane0 (MSVC forwards
//    the helper's store), and the cell index is `y * w + x`, not a base
//    accumulator: MSVC strength-reduces y * w itself into the esi induction
//    variable (initialised after the h > 0 test, as in the original), so
//    there is no walking pointer and no folding of the 0x18 header into the
//    index. A base accumulator gave either a walking pointer or a
//    base-starts-at-12 fold in every spelling.
//  - The falloff branch computes `int i = y * w + x;` FIRST, before g. That
//    is what keeps the index as one value used by both the store address
//    and the subtraction (`add esi, edi` straight after the fisubr).
//  - hw and hh are `short` locals and the falloff uses `w / 2 - dist`: the
//    int w/2 lives in the dead `lens` slot (fisubr dword) while the shorts
//    are sign-extended at each use. With an int hw, f and w/2 swap the two
//    dead parameter slots.
//
// What still differs: one instruction pair. After the inner loop the
// original restores the outer-loop registers in the order hw (ebx),
// hh (edx), y (eax), f (ecx); this file restores hh last
// (ebx, eax, ecx, edx). Measured, none of which gives the original's order
// (each keeps 99.3% or loses points): every order of the six set-up
// statements, int or short hw/hh with and without (short) casts, w / 2 or
// hw in the falloff and the f->x store, h / 2 or hh in the f->y store,
// declaring f/p/hw/hh/y up front in all 120 orders, dy as a variable or
// repeated, and a second pointer variable for the alloc result (that one
// reverses the restore order to edx, ecx, eax, ebx and loses 50 points).
// Also flat: loop and compare spellings, the value expression in ten
// groupings, y * w + x operand orders, /Gi (95.9%), and a 15-minute permuter
// run from this file (8531 candidates, no gain). The order looks like the
// outer-region allocation priority: writing the halving as
// `f->width = (unsigned short)(w * 2) / 2` (one f reference fewer) moves f
// to the end (ebx, eax, edx, ecx) but breaks the prologue (80.3%). So the
// original needs f a little lower and hh a little higher than here; the
// construct that does that is the lead for the next attempt.
