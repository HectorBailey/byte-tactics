// Decompiled by space-bunny-free, finished by muse-spark-1.3-free, deepseek-v4.1-flash. Names are provisional.
// space-bunny-free retry: retained 69.5%; found the n/m/q plateau is one register
// SHORT of the original, not a different function. Declaring n=count, m=copied and
// q=pc as function-scope locals (build/scratch/0x4d9ca0/v1.cpp, 60.7%, 629 bytes)
// DOES reproduce the original's frame: `sub esp,0x18`, `this` spilled to a slot,
// and slots copied=0x14, r=0x18, count=0x1c, i=0x10 all matching the original's
// 0x14/0x18/0x1c and 0x10. Two things are left, and only one is structural:
//   (a) EBP holds `len` where the original holds `i`; i is memory-resident at 0x10.
//   (b) this/pc take slots 0x24/0x20 where the original takes 0x20/0x24.
// Ladder in v1: esi=this, edi=scratch, ebx=p, ebp=len, memory={i,r,n,m,q,this}.
// Ladder in the original: esi=count/scratch, edi=scratch, ebx=p, ebp=i,
// memory={len,r,n,m,q,this}. So the whole function is ONE allocator decision
// (does `i` outrank `len` for EBP?) and I could not move it. Levers tried today,
// all byte-identical to v1 or v0, i.e. MSVC5 ignores them here:
//   declaration order of p/i/n/m/q/len (12 orders, a1..b3: all 60.7, all 629 bytes,
//     so the ladder is NOT declaration-order driven);
//   `int i;` with no initialiser (f1, 60.7); one `int i` per block (e3, 59.8);
//   `register int i` (e8, 60.7); two live copies of count, guard on one and loop
//     bound on the other (f7, f8, 60.7); m moved into the second block (f6, 60.0);
//   `&len` taken into a local pointer (e1, 60.7) and len reached through a
//     one-field local struct plus a reference (h1, 60.7) or i likewise (h2, 60.7):
//     len still lands in ebp, so scalar replacement puts it back;
//   from the v0 (69.5) side, adding one more dead local (z/y/u/e/w: c6..c10) leaves
//     the code byte-identical, so dead locals are removed before the allocator and
//     are NOT a pressure lever; only `n` moves it (59.4%), and downwards.
// Conclusion for the next attempt: the lever has to change len's or i's LIVE RANGE,
// not its type, count or order. Nothing in the source above does that.
// GPT-6 retry: retained 69.5%. Whole-formatter wrappers and per-loop
// append helpers did not improve allocation; original spill pattern remains.
// NOT A MATCH: 69.5% best (v18). Correct shapes found this run, allocation still open.
//
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (second run): re-derived from the disassembly and re-tested the
// pressure hypothesis. Confirmed the original frame is len=0x10, m=0x14, r/q=0x18,
// n/s=0x1c, this=0x20, pc=0x24 with ONLY p (ebx) and i (ebp) in registers; every value
// used only at a loop boundary (this, len, n, m, pc) stays memory-resident. Declaring
// n/m/q0 as top locals (v1: 59.8%, 630 bytes) makes MSVC promote len into ebp and this
// into esi and gives i edi plus a slot, i.e. it does the exact opposite. Same result for
// a different declaration order (v2 59.8), all-locals-at-function-scope (v5 60.6), a
// free __fastcall copy (v3, identical to thiscall, 69.5) and /Gr /Gz /Gd flags (no
// change for a member fn). Declaring only q0 on top of the 69.5 body collapses to 33.8
// (v7), matching the earlier note. So the missing lever is not "declare n/m/pc": it is
// making i win ebp over len/this while the boundary-only locals stay spilled.
//
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (first run): re-derived the whole function from the disassembly and
// swept ~60 source shapes. The 69.5% body below is still the best. What I confirmed:
// - The original caches BOTH counts in stack slots: n=count at [esp+0x1c], m=copied at
//   [esp+0x14], and pc at [esp+0x24]; this is spilled at [esp+0x20] and i lives in ebp.
//   Frame is 6 dwords (sub esp,0x18); ours is 4 (sub esp,0x10) with this in ebp.
// - Declaring `int n = count;` (or n+m, or n+m+q) drops the score to 61.1 and shrinks the
//   code to 629 bytes: the extra local makes MSVC give len ebp and this esi, it does NOT
//   reproduce the original's spill. Direct member reads for count (below) stay at 69.5.
// - tools/headers.py: 128 sets tried, all 69.5 (and 72 failed to compile), so no header fix.
// - N-declarations sweep (0..400 extern int dummies) is FLAT at 69.5, so this is not
//   compiler state; the source shape or the allocator's choice is what differs.
// - Declaring r/s/q at function scope, shared vs per-loop i, int vs unsigned len, self
//   pointer, inverted if/else, while loops, m via a reference: all <= 69.5.
// Remaining single cause (per the brief's lesson): this must lose ebp to i, and len/n/m/pc
// must all stay memory-resident. Every construct I found that lowers this's register weight
// also promotes len into ebp; the two are one decision I could not split from the source.
//
// CERTAIN (byte-exact regions in v18, verified against disassembly):
// - The grouped-bit conditions are SIGNED `i % 8`, not abs(): `i % 8` compiles to
//   exactly cdq/xor/sub/and/xor/sub with ONE cdq (see build/scratch/0x4d9ca0/abstest2.cpp,
//   g1), while abs(abs(i)&7) emits TWO cdqs. Original has one cdq in both loops.
// - `len` is unsigned (original breaks with jbe on `len <= 0x1e`; signed gives jle).
// - Loop 2 advances both walkers by one element (`q++; s++;`): the latch shares one
//   `mov eax,4` for both adds. (`q += 4` would emit add 16.)
// - `m = copied` up front as a named local helps (+4 over direct reads); the loop 2
//   bound and last-line check then read the slot exactly like the original.
// - Loop bodies use walking pointers (r/q/s) with per-iteration slot reloads;
//   `len -= strlen(p); p += strlen(p);` in that order with two strlen calls each.
// - Separator default " " is loaded before the modulo (ternary materialization).
//
// STILL WRONG (the whole remaining diff is one register-allocation decision):
// - Original keeps `this` memory-resident (spilled to [esp+0x20] in the prologue,
//   reloaded for the walker reseeds) with i in ebp, a count temp in esi, p in ebx,
//   six stack slots (sub esp,0x18). Mine keeps `this` in ebp, i in esi+memory slot.
// - Tried: up-front n (count) hurts (62.2), up-front q0 (pc) collapses (33.8),
//   up-front n+m (61.1), base=ret pointer uniformly 60.7 with len taking ebp,
//   shared single `int i` across loops (+0.9), decl-order shuffle (no change),
//   __inline RetPtr/StackPtr accessors (no change).
// - Hypothesis for next attempt: the prologue's copied/pc/count loads may be
//   MSVC-hoisted invariant loads (m succeeds as a real local but n/q0 do not),
//   so forcing them all into locals is the wrong model; the spill of `this`
//   likely needs a different pressure lever (single shared upstream cause per
//   brief lesson: the ebp/esi swap and the missing spill are one decision).

// deepseek-v4.1 (third run, 10-minute box): re-read the disassembly and re-measured the

// len and the walkers in memory with ONLY p=ebx, i=ebp and a temporary n=esi.
// Confirmed again that adding `int n = count;` (variant a, 59.4%, frame 0x14) makes MSVC
