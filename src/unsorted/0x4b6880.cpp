// Decompiled by Space Bunny Free, finished by GPT-6.1-sol and mimo-v2.6-pro. Names are provisional.
// Retry (GPT-6.1-sol, issue 3201): 7 checker invocations in this pass; best
// remains 88.2%. The arg6 prologue load is the only mismatch. Read-first
// declaration order scored 82.4%; delayed mask assignment scored 82.4%;
// if-assignment scored 81.1%; DWORD doRead and an LPDWORD alias matched the
// 88.2% baseline. No change to prior best source.
// #2992 retry by GPT-6.1-sol: three checks retained 88.2% (299/297 bytes); an
// arithmetic-mask variant fell to 82.4%. The prologue parameter load differs.
// Opens (or creates) HKCU\Software\Cavedog Entertainment\<subKey> and then
// either reads or writes one REG_DWORD / string / binary value in it.
// The decorated name is ?FUN_004b6880@@YGHPAD0PAEPAKKK@Z, so six stack
// arguments, ret 0x18.
//
// Retry (deepseek-v4.1-flash, issue 2435): re-confirmed 88.2%, 299 vs 297
// bytes. Only the 2-byte prologue differs: the original loads the 6th param
// straight into ebp (`mov ebp,[esp+0x30]; mov esi,ebp`) for the mask/doRead,
// ours hoists the load into eax and adds `mov ebp,eax`. doRead-first shapes
// make the mask read ebp but still load via eax (298 bytes, 82.4). A dummy
// sweep 0..64, headers.py (128 C plus 768 --cpp sets) and all order/type/mask
// spellings are flat, so it is a compiler-state tie.
//
// What this file reproduces:
// - The goto structure. All the failure exits jump to one `close:` label, and
//   the two success stores are written out in their own arms, which is what
//   makes MSVC duplicate `mov edi, 1` and put a `jmp` after each. With one
//   shared tail the store is emitted once and the function loses 4 bytes.
// - The frame holds four dwords, zeroed in the order key1, key2, key3, result,
//   which needs the three HKEYs declared with `= 0` and `result` zeroed by a
//   statement after them.
// - The result lives in edi: it is assigned 1 on both success paths and read
//   back from its stack slot on the failure path, then returned with
//   `mov eax, edi`.
// - `samDesired` is read ? KEY_READ : KEY_WRITE (`neg/sbb/and/add` in esi),
//   the flag copy is in ebp, and ebx holds the constant 0, so every comparison
//   is `cmp eax, ebx` and every zero argument is `push ebx`.
// - Every call result is stored in a LONG before it is compared, which is what
//   gives `cmp eax, ebx` rather than `test eax, eax`.
// - The read path accepts ERROR_SUCCESS and ERROR_MORE_DATA (0xea).
// - The ninth argument of all three RegCreateKeyExA calls is the address of
//   the sixth parameter, not of a local. Passing 0 instead loses the frame slot
//   and 12 bytes, so keep it.
//
// Still different (86.0% to 88.2% left on the table):
// - The prologue. The original loads the flag straight into ebp between the
//   two pushes and copies it into esi (`mov ebp, [esp+0x30]; push esi; mov esi,
//   ebp`); here MSVC hoists the load above `push ebx` into a scratch register
//   and copies it into esi early and ebp late, which costs 2 bytes. The
//   address of that same parameter is taken (passed as lpdwDisposition), and
//   that address-taken use is what stops MSVC folding the copy into a load:
//   every shape tried (flag declared first, samDesired computed from the local,
//   BOOL/unsigned/long flag, a separate `LPDWORD pRead`, passing 0) either
//   keeps the hoist or loses the frame.
//
// A later pass (Claude Sonnet 5.5, #566) scored about 30 more shapes with
// check.py --sym, all worse or equal, so do not repeat them:
// - every combination of order (`doRead` before or after `samDesired`), source of
//   the mask (`doRead` or `read`), type of the flag (`int`, `DWORD`,
//   `unsigned char`) and declaration (initialised or assigned later): 18 files.
//   `doRead` first with the mask taken from it gives 298 bytes (one over, 82.4
//   percent) but the load still goes into eax above `push ebx` and is copied to
//   ebp; `unsigned char` gives 300 to 301 bytes;
// - probes meant to stop MSVC unifying the two reads of `read` (the 0x4bfd60
//   trick): `*(int*)&read`, `read + 0`, `(doRead != 0)`, `doRead = doRead`,
//   reading the mask through `*(int*)&read`; an inline helper
//   `REGSAM Access(DWORD)` called with `doRead` or `read`, before or after the
//   flag. All 298 or 299 bytes, none moved the load.
// The difference is one fact: the original's load of `read` goes straight into
// ebp after `push ebp` (the flag's own register, so the mask is computed from a
// copy, `mov esi,ebp; neg esi`), while ours loads a temporary into eax at the
// top and copies it. Everything else (frame, zeroing order, exits, the doubled
// success stores) matches, and the 2-byte size difference is only this.
//
// Retry (Sonnet 5.5, #1107), no gain, 1 official run: /Gr, /Gz and /Gd give the
// same 88.2% (the function is already __stdcall and the callees are imports).
// A 3360-file scripted sweep of every declaration/statement order of result,
// key1..3, sam, doRead, err and the zeroing (key order fixed) topped out at
// 88.2% (the current shape, sam before doRead); every order with doRead first
// gives 298 bytes and 82.4%, where the load goes to eax, is copied to ebp, and
// the mask is negated in eax then moved to esi. Also flat or worse: if/else and
// KEY_WRITE + 0x13 forms of the mask, sam re-assigned from itself, the mask
// spelled in every call, and inline helpers taking DWORD, DWORD& or DWORD*.
// The original loads read straight into ebp (its own register) and copies it to
// esi for the neg; MSVC here always folds the two into one temporary.
// Retry (GPT-6.1-sol, #1164): 11 check.py invocations across both passes,
// counting the first pre-rebase invocation whose output was not captured. No
// gain from no-op self-assignment to key1, assigning read to result before its
// zero initialization, `register` on doRead, `read = read`, or copying doRead
// back to read. A bool doRead drops to 32.3%. Reversing the ternary condition
// is byte-identical to the baseline. The residual remains the prologue arg6
// load: original loads directly into ebp after push ebp; MSVC hoists it into
// eax and copies it to esi and ebp.
//
// Retry (mimo-v2.6-pro, #3996): no change to the 88.2% best. Confirmed there
// are exactly two canonical layouts and the original is a third one. Layout
// (a), two reads of `read` unified into one temp load (the current file): the
// mask chain runs in the mask web esi with `mov esi,eax`, the flag copy
// `mov ebp,eax` is placed late (299 bytes). Layout (b), one flag local whose
// value feeds the chain (`int doRead = read; samDesired = doRead ? ...`): the
// chain runs destructively in the load's temp register, the flag is copied out
// early and the chain result moves into the mask web late (298 bytes, 82.4).
// The original is layout (c): the load lands directly in the flag web ebp (so
// it is forced below `push ebp`, which is why it sits between `push ebp` and
// `push esi`), one copy `mov esi,ebp` feeds the chain, and the chain extends
// the mask web. Every spelling tried here collapses into (a) or (b): const
// flag, assignment-in-condition `(doRead = read) ? ...`, comma expressions,
// err declared first, `*(int*)&read` for the second read, explicit maskSrc
// copies (copy propagation folds them), and mask-source/order swaps.
// Testing `read` directly (no pre-call copy) makes MSVC reload it after the
// calls (its address escapes through lpdwDisposition) into a 295-byte shape,
// so the tested value must be a pre-call register copy. A dummy-declaration
// sweep of 0..2200 extern ints (step 4/8, parallel check.py --sym) is flat on
// both layouts (base 88.2 everywhere, layout (b) 82.4 everywhere), so this is
// not the small compiler-state window kind of residual either. Remaining
// hypothesis: the original somehow makes the load's web BE the flag web while
// the chain still coalesces with the mask web, a combination MSVC 5's web
// construction refused under every source shape on record.
