// Decompiled by space-bunny-free, finished by deepseek-v4.1-flash, and GPT-6.1-sol. Names are provisional.
// Retry #1758: GPT-6.1-sol confirmed 80.9% after four checks; no MATCH. The focus==index block still changes zero rematerialization, register allocation and branch layout.
// GPT-6 retry: retained 80.9%. Full-width/partial-width zero value variants
// did not recover the original edx zero; detailed previous notes remain below.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash retry: no change to the code, still 80.9% and NOT a match.
// New facts about the remaining diff, so the next attempt does not repeat them:
// an N-declaration sweep (0 to 400 unused `extern int`) leaves the score flat
// at 80.9%, so this is source shape, not compiler state. Operand-order
// respellings change nothing (`0 == obj->field_78`, `0 > e->off`,
// `0 != obj->holder`, `obj->field_78 == 0` all give byte-identical output).
// A `int zero = 0;` declared at the top of the focus block and used for the
// field_78 store, the `e->off < 0` clamp and the holder test still folds the
// store back to the call result in `eax`, so the zero never survives. `short v`
// in the wheel arm, a per-arm `old`, a single shared `off` with one
// `e->off = off` after the if/else, `e->off--`/`e->off++`, `switch`-style
// conditional stores, an `int f94`, and a `!= 1` spelling of the call test all
// score below 80.9% (between 47% and 74%), several of them by breaking the
// shared store at 0x4a427b. What is still unexplained: the original's
// `xor edx, edx` in BOTH arms of the FUN_004ab5b0 test means the 0 is a phi at
// the merge, i.e. it is live on both paths, yet every literal-zero spelling
// the front end sees is folded or rematerialised. A real variable that is 0 on
// both paths and read after the merge is the only shape left.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash retry (issue 1202): tools/headers.py with all 128 header
// sets (and the file's own structs) is also flat at 80.9%, so the edx zero is
// not a compiler-state or header effect. Rechecked the 0x4a3ef0 lesson by
// declaring `int zero = 0;` right after the FUN_004a23b0 call (not at the top
// of the focus block): still 80.9%, MSVC folds it to `mov [ebp+0x78], eax` and
// `cmp word [ebx+0x140], 0` exactly as before. No change to the code.
// Sonnet 5.5 retry (#1080): no change to the code. /Gz and /Gr give the same 80.9%. The original zero in edx is not reachable with an `int zero = 0` local, a local assigned 0 in both arms, or named locals for the call results, the drag flag, the holder and the offset (about 150 variants): MSVC folds every one back to immediates. In 0x4a3ef0 a zero local that is reassigned LATER (`int lines = 0;` then `lines = ...` in one arm), declared after the last call before the block, did create the zero register, so look for a real variable in this block that starts at 0 and is reassigned on some path.
// Not a match yet, 80.9%. The whole prologue, the entry-address computation,
// the 24-byte point copy, the FUN_004a23b0 call, both FUN_004ab510 tail
// blocks (right-button arm down to `mov [ebp+0x94], dx`) and the whole
// FUN_004ab510/FUN_0049fc50/FUN_004ab690 tail match byte for byte. What is
// left is inside the `obj->focus == index` block, and all of it comes from one
// decision: the original keeps the literal 0 in a register (edx) for the whole
// block, so it spends `xor edx, edx` in both arms of the FUN_004ab5b0 test
// and then uses `cmp [ebp+0x78], edx` / `mov word [ebx+0x140], dx` /
// `cmp eax, edx`. This file lets MSVC rematerialise the 0 as an immediate, so
// it loads `mov eax, [ebp+0x78]; test eax, eax` instead. That costs two
// instructions at the top of the block and then cascades:
//   - edx is free, so MSVC picks `dl` for the flags byte where the original
//     uses `al` (and a memory operand for the same byte in the wheel arm),
//   - the clamp block picks esi/edx where the original picks edi/esi,
//   - in the tail MSVC then needs a zero register, takes edi, kills p.y and
//     reloads it from [esp+0x34] and r1[1] into eax.
// Forcing the constant into a register needs one more literal-0 use in that
// block (an `int zero = 0` local, tried, changes nothing) or one more live
// value in eax; neither was found.
// The one place the original's arithmetic is questionable: `mov ax,
// word [ebp+0x94]; sub ax, word [ebp+0x7c]; add eax, esi` narrows the
// difference to 16 bits and then adds a 32-bit value without sign extension,
// so the high half of the result is whatever eax happened to hold. Reproduced
// here, but it looks like an original bug.
// Shapes that scored worse and are worth knowing about: one merged `v` with a
// single `e->off = v` after the if/else moves `index` into ebx and spills `e`
// (40.8%); a `?:` for the drag arm keeps the shared store but widens the
// subtract to 32 bits (61.6%); duplicating both arms so MSVC cross-jumps the
// tails does not cross-jump at all (49.0%); declaring the old offset
// uninitialised and assigning it in each arm, or hoisting `f94` out of the
// drag arm, both cost the shared store (73.5% and 73.7%).
