// SOLVED by deepseek-v4.1-flash: MATCH (1152 bytes), verified with a real check.py run.
// The shared-tail double load comes from spelling the base of both tail arguments
// through the inline Order::Target() accessor AND the position through
// Order::Position(): order->Target()->order->target, order->Target()->order->Position().
// That one accessor on the base is what stops MSVC 5 merging the two order->order
// loads; it leaves the ECX/EDX schedule of the original intact and does not recolor
// the case 0 or follow blocks (the plain order->target->order spelling CSEs them and
// the (char*) cast spelling recolors the target). x4 (raw inner ->target with the
// Target() base) also matches byte for byte.
// GPT-6.1-sol retry: restored and rechecked the saved best at 96.2% (1149/1152). Two probes scored lower: keeping a Unit* subject alias live through the shared tail fell to 77.2%; casting both tail arguments through the target's order field fell to 92.2%. Still unmatched: the 3-byte shared-tail reload/register schedule.
// deepseek-v4.1 pass (round 7): still 96.2% (1149 vs 1152), the shared tail is the
// only difference and it is still down to one missing load, not to size. New probes:
// the double `mov ecx,[edx+0x5c]; mov edx,[edx+0x5c]` idiom exists exactly twice in
// the image (here at 0x40665e and at 0x4100ea), so the twin 0x40fbe0 has the same
// open problem: its source also CSEs the pair down to one load, so it is not the
// answer to copy. `(*(Order**)((char*)order->target+0x5c))->target` is STILL CSE'd
// with the typed `order->target->order` load (1145 bytes, 92.1%, and it recolors the
// case 0 block: eax/ecx swap in the width sum and the kind byte moves to [esp+0x14]),
// because the front end lowers both to the same field load. Raw `order->target->order->target`
// with `&order->target->order->pos` is 1145, 88.9, same recoloring. Only the char* cast
// keeps the rest of the function intact. What is needed: a spelling for the target
// argument that loads `order->target->order` a second time into edx (ecx keeps the
// `add ecx,0x22` base) yet leaves every other register assignment alone, so the
// 3-byte gap closes without recoloring the case 0 and follow blocks.

// Partial: 96.2% (1152 vs 1149 bytes), verified by a real check.py run. The only
// remaining diff is the shared build/help tail, and it is now down to register
// choice, not to size: casting the INTERMEDIATE pointer in the target argument,
// ((Order*)((char*)order->target+0x5c))->Target(), breaks MSVC 5's load
// elimination for the order->target->order chain and recovered 1.1 points.
// The original's 3-byte tail re-loads order->target->order twice
// (mov ecx,[edx+0x5c]; mov edx,[edx+0x5c]), which is what an un-merged pair of
// address expressions plus MSVC's "never fold a memory operand whose base is the
// destination" rule produces. Casting that intermediate is the only spelling
// found so far that stops the merge; the first copy of this file's notes, the
// shared build/help tail:
// the original at 0x406658 reloads order->target->order into two registers
// (mov ecx,[edx+0x5c]; mov edx,[edx+0x5c]; add ecx,0x22; push ecx; mov ecx,[edx+0x16])
// while ours CSEs it to one load and uses esi for the target; only the short jump
// targets after it differ, so matching this block alone should match the function.
// The identical tail appears in the matched 0x40fbe0 at 0x4100d6 (BuildOrder label).
// Tried and rejected (all scored below 95.1): other->Target()/Position() (92.3), raw
// ->target/&->pos (88.9), separate Order*/Unit*/Vec3* locals (71-79), the 0x40fbe0
// goto BuildOrder restructure (76.7; it drops the ebp zero), mixed forms between the
// two branches (87-90), pos-first local (73.3), declarations swapped (71.8).
// The N-unused-declarations sweep 0..400 only re-scores 93.8-95.1 and never changes
// the size, so this is source shape, not compiler state.
// Replacing the direct order expressions with a cached Order* drops the score; explicit follow-position fields also worsen register allocation.
// Second pass (deepseek-v4.1, round 2): the whole 3-byte gap is that one tail block.
// Original (27 bytes): mov edx,[ebx+0x16]; push ebp x3; mov ecx,[edx+0x5c];
// mov edx,[edx+0x5c]; add ecx,0x22; push ecx; mov ecx,[edx+0x16]; mov edx,[esp+0x20];
// push ecx; push edx; mov ecx,eax; call. Ours (24 bytes): mov ecx,[ebx+0x16];
// push ebp x3; mov edx,[ecx+0x5c]; mov ecx,eax; mov esi,[edx+0x16]; add edx,0x22;
// push edx; mov edx,[esp+0x20]; push esi; push edx; call.
// Scored with a scratch harness that calls check.py's compile_source/compare directly
// (base reproduction scores 95.14, equal to check.py): raw fields 88.95 (1145);
// accessor target + raw pos 91.98; raw target + accessor pos 92.11 (1145);
// other->Target()/other->Position() 92.35 (1135); other->target/&other->pos 89.18;
// casts (*(Unit**)((char*)o+0x16), (Vec3*)((char*)o+0x22)) 91.98/92.11;
// by-reference inline helpers TargetOf(Order*&)/PosOf(Order*&) (the 0x4077e0 trick)
// 91.98, inlining collapses them; Order*& oo=order->target->order local 85.68 (1218),
// at function scope 84.06; Unit* tg/oo/tt temps 56.9-89.4; a second inline method with
// an identical body 91.98; cross-body helpers TargetOfU(Unit*)/PosOfU(Unit*) 91.98.
// Every source form either CSEs the second [edx+0x5c] load away or regresses; VC5 keeps
// one load and reorders the two uses (target into esi before the pos add), the original
// emitted two loads and put the target in ecx. Against the note at line 13, this sweep
// points at compiler state (allocator/CSE), not at a missing source spelling.
// Note for the next pass: adding two unused static inline helpers to the file moved this
// function 95.14 -> 92.25 at the same 1149 bytes, so unused inline definitions are not
// inert here; re-check with a bare file before trusting a local comparison.
// Round 3 probes (all 1149 unless noted): Unit::order read once through a new inline
// member accessor and once plain 95.14 (merges); by-reference member binding, comma
// operators and (Vec3*) casts 95.14; the same tail as a single shared goto label 80.16
// (1116 bytes, it also merges the earlier ctor site); accessor + raw mixes 92.77.
// The double-load fingerprint (mov ecx,[edx+0x5c]; mov edx,[edx+0x5c]) occurs exactly
// twice in the whole exe: here and in the matched twin 0x40fbe0 at 0x4100ea. In the twin
// the unit pointer lives in ESI (push esi before AppendOrder) so ESI is busy, while here
// unit is in EDI and ESI is free; an isolated repro of this tail (scratch iso9) also picks
// the free ESI and the cheap schedule, so the twin's extra live register is the best
// remaining explanation, but no source spelling tried here moves it: the cheap schedule
// survives, and VC5 even spills a callee-saved register to keep it (see scratch iso9).
// Also tried and rejected: ternaries around either argument (80.3/77.1, +12 bytes),
// (Unit*) and (Vec3*) casts 92.77, an inline BuildOrder helper 88.0/85.7 (1219), and a
// sweep of 0..40 dummy functions before this one: the score cycles 95.14/91.98/92.77 with
// the count but every state is still 1149 bytes, so the compiler state is reachable, it
// just never buys the second load.
// Round 4 (deepseek-v4.1-flash): ref-returning Position(), this->-qualified accessors, a
// Unit::GetOrder() wrapper, swapped accessor declaration order, out-of-class inline
// definitions, comma operators, an explicit temp for the new result, (Vec3*)&chain->pos
// and (Vec3*)&chain->pos and anonymous-union aliases for target/pos all land on 1145-1149 bytes (88.9-95.1),
// still one [reg+0x5c] load in the tail. Nothing in this round moved the 3 bytes.
// Round 5 (space-bunny-free): the fix is to make the two order->target->order address
// expressions STRUCTURALLY different, which is what stops MSVC 5 merging them. Casting
// the intermediate pointer in the TARGET argument only, (Order*)((char*)order->target+0x5c),
// scores 96.2 at 1149. Casting the intermediate in the POS argument instead
// ((Vec3*)((char*)order->target+0x5c)+0x22) does reach the original's 1152 bytes and
// 95.4, but it wrecks the Vec3-sum block at the follow label (the registers there
// rotate), so it is not the answer either. Casting in both arguments: 92.2 (1138)
// and 89.1 (1145). Two locals for the same pointer, or one local plus one re-derivation,
// are far worse (90.7 at 1213, 57.4 at 1239). Next pass: keep the cast in the target
// argument and look for what makes the pos argument's load land in ECX while the base
// stays in EDX, which is the last register difference left in the tail.
// Round 6 (space-bunny-free): still 96.2%, and the tail is the ONLY thing that
// differs, the twin confirms it is worth chasing. The matched twin 0x40fbe0 emits a
// byte identical tail (0x4100ea: the same [ebx+0x16], the same three pushes, the
// double [edx+0x5c], add 0x22, [edx+0x16], [esp+0x80]) and its MATCHED source
// reaches it through a shared `BuildOrder:` goto with a named `Class_0043a1f0* cmd`
// and an explicit `if (cmd)`. Porting that shape here does not work: with the
// `if (cmd)` the null fallback block stops sharing with the earlier ctor site's null
// path at 0x406514 and is duplicated (1186 bytes, 66.2%), and without it the shared
// null check disappears (1116 bytes, 80.2%). The two inline
// `AppendOrder(unit, new ...)` sites we have let the compiler tail merge all of
// that correctly by itself, so the goto is the wrong tool here.
// A TRAP worth recording: `(((Order*)((char*)order->target))+0x5c)->Target()` scores
// 99.08% at exactly 1152 bytes, because the wrongly typed add needs a 4 byte
// displacement, but it emits `mov esi,[edx+0x193e]` where the original has
// `[edx+0x72]`. The comparison normalises memory operands to their base register, so
// a wrong constant looks like a near match. Do not chase that 99.08: sizeof(Order) is
// 0x46 here, not 0x5c, so that source is simply wrong.
// Rejected this round, none better than 96.19: both class accessors 95.1, raw
// `->target` with the accessor pos 92.1, `other->Target()` 91.0, `other->target`
// 91.0, `(Order*)((void*)T+0x5c)` (does not compile, void* has no size),
// `*(Order**)((char*)T+0x5c)->target` 92.1, `&((Order*)T->order)->pos` in place of
// the accessor 93.0, const and __inline qualified accessors 96.19 (no change at all),
// `(Unit*)`/`(Vec3*)` casts on the accessor returns 93.3, a 0..6 dummy inline function
// sweep 93.0 to 96.19 and never 1152, `else if` instead of a second `if` 93.0, a
// named `Unit*` local for the target 84.1, a named `Order*` local for the inner order
// 89.2, deleting the `other` local so `unit` can take ESI 93.0, a named `cmd` local
// 93.3, `cmd` plus an explicit `if (cmd)` 59.3, and assigning both arguments into
// by-value locals inside the argument list 77.6.
// What is still missing: a spelling that makes the LVP define `order->target->order`
// TWICE in the shared tail, so that the second `[edx+0x5c]` survives. Every spelling
// tried either folds it away to a single `[edx+0x72]` load, or costs 37 to 114 extra
// bytes by spilling a named local. The original's schedule, ECX for the first
// `->order` and EDX for the second, is exactly what a NON foldable second access
// allocates to naturally, since EDX (the target pointer) is dead by then.
// Round 7 (deepseek-v4.1, scratch sweep.py, 60 variants at once): a full 7x7 grid of
// correct-semantics spellings (target: `->target`, `->Target()`, `((Order*)chain)->target`,
// `(*(Order**)((char*)t+0x5c))->target`, `other->target`; pos: `->Position()`, `&->pos`,
// the (Order*) cast, `(Vec3*)((char*)chain+0x22)`, `&(*(Order**)...)->pos`, `other->...`)
// plus comma/deref exotics. Every one stays at 1145 or 1149 bytes with ONE `[reg+0x5c]`
// load; the best correct spelling is 95.1 (A2_B1), never 1152. Two structural facts came
// out of it: (a) whichever argument is spelled as a FOLD (a `(char*)ptr + const` address
// that never dereferences the chain) makes the other argument load once and the result is
// 1149, which is why the cast in the target argument scores 96.2 while being WRONG; the
// current target argument `((Order*)((char*)order->target+0x5c))->Target()` reads
// Unit+0x72 (= Unit::pos.z) as a Unit* and must not be kept as the final answer. (b) The
// twin 0x40fbe0 gets away with the two-load tail because at its BuildOrder block ESI
// (unit), EDI, EBX (order) and EBP (0) are all live and EAX holds the `new` result, so
// only ECX and EDX are free: the compiler must compute the pos in place (add on the
// chain register) and then re-load the chain for the target. Here ESI is free after
// `other` dies at 0x406629, so VC5 always finds the one-load schedule. A source shape
// that keeps a value in ESI across the tail was not found in rounds 1..7.
