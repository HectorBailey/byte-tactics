// MATCH, 844 bytes against 844 (Space Bunny Free, issue 4156). It sat at 82.3% /
// 847 bytes for many passes. Four source changes took it to MATCH, and every one
// of them is load-bearing, so do not "tidy" any of them away:
//
//  1. The height test has to be written in the positive direction:
//         if (mf->height + cell->ground > proj->py.s.hi) { ... } else { mf = 0; }
//     and not as `if (mf->height + cell->ground <= proj->py.s.hi) mf = 0; else
//     ...`. The positive form is what puts the sum in eax and proj->py.s.hi in
//     edx (`cmp eax, edx / jle`, the original's own order) and frees ax for the
//     cellZ compare. The negative form gives `xor edx,edx` first and swaps both.
//     Worth 0.7 points on its own and it was the unblocking change.
//  2. There is NO `Game* g = g_game;` local. Reading `g_game->` at
//     every use is what keeps g_game in edi from 0x49b1ca to 0x49b3ba, which in
//     turn spills cz to [esp+0x30], produces the single `mov edi,[g_game]` in
//     the cellX/cellZ store branch, and lets both feature-map arms merge into
//     the shared `g->mapping + f*256` tail at 0x49b31b. A local holding g_game
//     is live across the two DetonateProjectile calls in the unit blocks, so MSVC 5
//     gives it a stack home, and one compile state change then moves every other
//     allocation with it. Worth 7.3 points.
//  3. The 0xfffe arm's index is spelled `cell->offX + g_game->width * cell->offY`
//     and its feature id is an `unsigned short`. Together they give the original's
//     `mov ecx,[width] / xor eax,eax / mov al,[ebx+0xa] / xor edx,edx /
//     imul ecx,eax` instead of `imul ecx,[edi+0x14233]` with offY in cl, and the
//     `mov dx,[edx+8] / cmp dx,0xfffb` with the `and edx,0xffff` after the
//     branch. With `int f2` the address register ends up in ecx and the two
//     mapping tails never merge; with `unsigned short f2` and the old index
//     spelling they do. The two are not independent, and the branch shape below
//     is part of the same allocation.
//  4. The outer chain is `if (f < 0xfffb) { ... } else if (!(f == 0xfffe)) {
//     mf = 0; } else { <0xfffe arm> }`, not `else if (f == 0xfffe) { <arm> }
//     else { mf = 0; }`. The same CFG, but the block order and therefore the
//     three separate `xor ecx,ecx` blocks and the jump into 0x49b31b come out
//     right only in this spelling.
//
// `tools/headers.py` also matters here, and not for the SIB swaps this file used
// to need: <windows.h> alone scores 90.6% and <windows.h> plus <ddraw.h> scores
// 91.3% (ddraw.h fixes the unit0 `mov ebp,[eax+0x6e]` vs `mov ecx,...` swap on
// its own, which no source shape ever reached), but only <stdio.h> gets the
// feature block's allocation right. So the header is <stdio.h> and nothing else.
//
// The harness for the last part is in build/scratch/0x49b090/: hs.py applies a
// list of text rewrites to base.cpp, writes each variant into v/ and scores it
// with `check.py <addr> <file> --sym <mangled>`, which never touches
// src/weapons/weapons_49b090.cpp and takes about 0.6 s a variant. Roughly 130 source
// shapes are recorded below as flat 90.6%.
//
// Everything after this point is the record of the earlier partial attempts and
// of the negative results, kept because they say what does not work.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (issue 3314 retry, 10 min): body reconfirmed at 82.3% / 847 bytes against 844;
// no new shape tried beat it. Left as is, with the diff exactly as described below.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (issue 2893 retry, 10 min): body left at 82.3% / 847 bytes against 844, still the
// best. This pass tried ~35 more source shapes, all CSE'd or scored lower: feature-block ternaries
// (v_tern1/v_tern2, equal), branch reorder 0xfffe-first (80.6), `mf = 0` init with conditional assigns
// (79.1), a single mapping tail via an fi sentinel (79.3), named `map`/`fc` feature locals (80.6/73.7),
// redundant callee-saved aliases c2/p2/t2 (equal) and a second g2 (75.2), `int f` (81.1), `int cx/cz`
// (81.7), `unsigned short` cx/cz (81.2/81.5), moving cx/cz inside `if (mf)` (77.5), unit0 spellings
// `u->elev + u->type->high`, subtraction, `>` and hi/el/sum temps (equal/81.6/81.3/79.7/69.3), inlining
// cx/cz at both uses (76.9/75.8/63.1), a named `owner` local (63.5), `py` local (76.6), reference g
// (78.0), no-g direct g_game (81.1), direct g_game only in the feature block (75.2). Every spelling of
// the feature block CSEs to the same 847 bytes, so the g-in-edi vs cz-in-edi split is a global
// allocation choice that no source shape tried reaches; the mapping tail stays duplicated.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (issue 2421 retry, 10 min): current body scores 82.3% / 847 bytes against 844, and
// nothing in this retry beat it, so the body is unchanged. Tried and scored lower or equal: unit0
// operand swap `u->elev + u->type->high` (same bytes, same diff), `int` cx/cz (81.7/82.2), cz declared
// first (80.2), extra `(void)cz` use (equal), two fresh locals gu/gf instead of reusing `g` (equal),
// the whole feature block written with direct `g_game->` (81.1: this DOES put g_game in edi, but it
// changes the feature-block expression shapes and duplicates the mapping tail anyway), direct `g_game->`
// only after the flags test (81.1), `g = g_game;` moved inside the block after the flags test (76.3),
// `g` left uninitialised and assigned (equal), local sum/fresh-elev spellings of the unit0 high test
// (69.3/79.7/81.6), rewriting the feature block with a shared `f` index (equal), a flag + single
// `mapping + f` tail (75.3), and adding `g = g_game;` in the cellX/cellZ store branch (82.0 / 856).
// What still differs is unchanged: g_game is not kept in edi after 0x49b284 (ours copies it to ecx and
// spills to [esp+0x30], and cz takes edi), plus the unit0 elev/high pair is swapped, the mapping tail
// is duplicated instead of merged at 0x49b31b, and the final block reloads g from [esp+0x30].
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (issue 1715): 73.6% -> 81.9% (855 bytes against 844). Three changes, all in the
// source shape, none of them register hints: (1) delete the `int oz = proj->py.i;` local and read
// `proj->py.i` directly in the unit0 test, which removes the hoisted `mov ebp,[esi+8]`; (2) declare
// `Game* g = g_game;` and reassign `g = g_game;` immediately before the 0x4000 flags test,
// which is what makes MSVC emit the single `mov edi,[g_game]` reload at 0x49b284 instead of keeping a
// spilled g; (3) replace `MapFeature* mf = 0;` with an uninitialised `mf` and explicit `else mf = 0;`
// in every arm, which moves the `xor` out of the declaration and lands the feature-id load at the
// original's position. Still differs (all ~11 bytes): MSVC homes the new g in ecx and re-spills it to
// [esp+0x30] so the cellZ temp takes edi (`mov ecx,edi` + `mov [esp+0x30],ecx` extra), the unit0
// elev/high pair is swapped (ours ecx=elev,ebp=high; original ebp=elev,ecx=high), and the
// `mapping + f` tail is duplicated instead of merged at 0x49b31b. Ledger has the scored variants.
// GPT-6 retry: <windows.h> improves to 75.2%, not MATCH. Collision and
// feature lookup helper, width and reference variants did not improve the
// baseline. Game/height allocation and feature tail still differ.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash (issue 1400 retry): reconfirmed 73.6% / 842 bytes against
// 844, no variant beat it. Scored with check.py --sym: removing oz, using
// proj->py.i directly twice, drops to 62% / 866 and moves cell to ebp, g to ebx;
// block-local oz in each unit block is 59.2% / 869; oz = pos->y is 53.1% / 878;
// an early `unsigned short u1 = cell->unit1` is 61% / 847. The allocator always
// refuses g_game in edi once proj->py.i is a live value, so the first diff (the
// hoisted `mov ebp,[esi+8]` plus the g spill) is the whole problem; see below.
// deepseek-v4.1-flash retry: still 73.6%, 842 bytes against 844, no variant
// improved on it. Removing the `oz` local (direct proj->py.i in both unit
// blocks), moving it into the unit0 block, reading it through `pos`, swapping
// which block uses it, adding a second pointer local `q = proj`, and moving
// `g = g_game` earlier or later all produced the same 842-byte code (MSVC CSEs
// every spelling of the py load into one hoisted load in ebp). Declaring `g`
// early or dropping the `g` local entirely scored lower (59.3%, 72.8%). So the
// py load hoist and the g spill are one allocator state, not source-shape
// problems, and the notes below about the g-in-edi cause still stand.
// Not matched yet: 73.6%, 842 bytes against 844 (Sonnet 5.5 retry, #1097; was 72.8%). This header was rewritten
// because the previous one still described the 66.0% / 870-byte state, which
// the current body no longer has.
// Retry note: a `Game* g = g_game;` local declared just before
// `if (cell->unit0)` (all later g_game-> uses go through it) gave +0.8 points and the
// right size. Still differs as described below: `oz` is hoisted into a register
// (ebp) where the original loads proj->py.i inside each unit block, and g then
// spills to [esp+0x30] and mf takes edi. About 150 variants (oz and g placement,
// block-local y, extra locals for ground and height, declaration order of
// cx/cz/f/mf) never moved it; without oz the cell lands in ebp, with it in ebx.
//
// 0x49b090 is the projectile collision test. It looks up the map cell holding
// the projectile with FUN_004815a0(&proj->pos); if there is none it stores the
// selected projectile's last position and sound, clears the selection, sets the
// dead flag and returns. Otherwise: (1) if the projectile is attached to a unit,
// the 64-bit squared distance is checked against type->radius^2 and the
// projectile is killed on contact; (2) proj->radius is set to
// (cell->radius + cell->ground) / 2; (3) the two unit indices in the cell are
// tested against proj->owner and the height window
// [type->low + elev, type->high + elev]; (4) the map-feature id is resolved,
// including the 0xfffe "read the neighbour cell" case, and if the feature is new
// for this cell the cell coordinates are stored; (5) the 0x8000 and 0x10000 flag
// rules, the g_game->limit ceiling and the netgame check are applied before the
// final kill.
//
// Two fixes moved it from 66.0% / 870 bytes to 72.8% / 852 bytes, and both are
// counter-intuitive, so do not "tidy" either one away:
//
// 1. The prologue register swap IS solved, and the fix is in the position
//    spelling rather than in any register hint. The position must be read
//    through a NAMED `Pos_0049b090* pos` local whose value is used again after
//    the cell lookup (as in `int dx = pos->x - proj->unit->pos.x;`), not read
//    inline as `proj->px.i`. That alone makes the original's own prologue
//    (`lea edi, [esi+4] / push edi`), its entire 64-bit distance block and its
//    radius block come out byte exact, including the interleaved load order
//    (py, px, pz) and the `mov ebp, eax / mov [esp+0x1c], edx` spill sequence.
//    The previous header concluded from a true longest-common-subsequence over
//    instructions that neither ordering wins (165/282 against 168/282). That
//    comparison was sound but it was made before the position was read through
//    a named local, and with the named local the original's order does win.
// 2. The cell register is `ebx`, not `ebp`, and about 30 expression-shape
//    variants (declaration orders, commutativity, control flow, extra locals in
//    other regions) all failed to move it. The only thing that flipped it was a
//    change to the SET of live variables: one extra `int` local, declared just
//    before the `if (cell->unit0)` block and used once inside that block, makes
//    MSVC 5 give the cell ebx instead of ebp. 64.9% before, 72.8% after. This
//    is the reusable lesson: in a register-starved function the choice between
//    ebx and ebp for a long-lived local can be flipped by adding a single live
//    local in a specific region, and the two orderings are otherwise
//    indistinguishable to every spelling sweep.
//
// 3. The flag word at ProjType+0x111 is a bitfield struct, not a plain unsigned
//    int. The original tests bit 14 as `test ah, 0x40` and bit 16 as
//    `test dword ptr [m], 0x10000`, but bit 15 as
//    `mov eax,[m]; shr eax,0xf; test al,1; je`. ONLY a 1-bit bitfield read
//    produces the shift form: `flags & 0x8000` and `(flags >> 15) & 1` both
//    fold to `test ah, 0x80` (probed directly in
//    build/scratch/0x49b090/probe1..3.cpp). The working spelling is a union of
//    the raw word with a bitfield view:
//        union TypeFlags_0049b090 {
//            unsigned int raw;
//            struct { unsigned int low : 15; unsigned int b15 : 1;
//                     unsigned int high : 16; } b;
//        };
//    used as `type->flags.raw & 0x4000`, `type->flags.b.b15`,
//    `type->flags.raw & 0x10000`. Worth about 3 points once the register
//    layout is right.
//
// What still differed at the time this note was written (the 73.6% source; all of
// it is fixed now, see the MATCH note at the top), all of it in the last third
// of the function, and all of it traced to one cause: `g_game` was not kept in
// edi across the unit blocks and the feature block. In the original edi holds
// g_game from 0x49b1ca to 0x49b3ba; in that source the extra local from fix 2
// above took edi and g_game was reloaded (`mov eax,[g_game]; mov ecx,[eax+0x14357]`).
// That one cause explained all of:
//   - the duplicated `mapping + f*256` tail, because the original merges both
//     arms into the shared block at 0x49b31b and that build did not;
//   - `mf` living in edi instead of ecx;
//   - `cmp cx, ax` against the original's `cmp dx, ax` at 0x49b3ad;
//   - the `mov [esp+0x30]` reload of g_game at 0x49b3ad and 0x49b3ba.
// Two smaller items alongside it:
//   - `cz` is kept in ax instead of being spilled to [esp+0x30], so the cellZ
//     test is `cmp word ptr [esi+0x5c], ax` where the original has
//     `mov ax,[esi+0x5c]; cmp ax, word ptr [esp+0x30]`.
//   - in the feature block the feature id is zero-extended eagerly
//     (`xor edx,edx` + `and ecx,0xffff`) where the original defers it to
//     `mov dx,[ebx+8]` and an `and edx,0xffff` on the taken path only.
//
// Where to look next, in order (items 1 and 2 were the answer: delete the
// `Game* g` local entirely, item 3 became hs.py in the scratch dir):
//   1. The g_game-in-edi problem, which is the highest value. Not yet tried: an
//      extra variable live only in a region where edi is dead (before
//      0x49b1ca or after 0x49b284), two extra variables whose net register cost
//      is zero, or a `Game*` local declared so the compiler
//      rematerialises g_game rather than keeping it.
//   2. Forcing the cz spill to [esp+0x30], for instance by giving cz a second
//      use, which should also fix the cellX/cellZ compare shape.
//   3. The reusable harness is in build/scratch/0x49b090/ (gen.py, rg.py,
//      try*.py, probe*.cpp, sweep1.py). It scores a variant in about 0.3 s
//      with `check.py --sym`, which is why this pass used no check.py runs at
//      all.
//
// Suspected original bug, now confirmed byte for byte: 0x49b2c8 to 0x49b2d6 range-checks the map-feature id against
// g_game+0x14253, but the 0xfffe reload path at 0x49b2e7 to 0x49b30f re-tests
// only against 0xfffb and skips the count check, so a feature id read from the
// neighbouring cell indexes g_game->mapping unchecked.

// Only <stdio.h>, and only because tools/headers.py found it: <windows.h> scores
// 90.6% and <windows.h> plus <ddraw.h> scores 91.3%, but neither gives the
// feature block the register plan the original has. Nothing here is used from it.
#include <stdio.h>

// deepseek-v4.1-flash (issue 4021 retry, 10 min): body kept at 82.3% / 847
// bytes. One more shape tried: arm2 of the feature map reusing the same `f`
// variable (`f = (cell - n)->feature;`) instead of a separate f2, hoping VC5
// would merge the two mapping tails at 0x49b31b; it is byte-neutral at 82.3% /
// 847 (same diff), so the merge is still out of reach. The residual is
// unchanged: g_game is not kept in edi after 0x49b284 (ours copies it to ecx
// and spills to [esp+0x30]), the unit0 elev/high pair is swapped, the mapping
// tail is duplicated instead of merged at 0x49b31b, and the final block
// reloads g from [esp+0x30].
